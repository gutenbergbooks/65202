<p class='pindent'>“Just look at it rain!” exclaimed Nan Bobbsey
to her brother Bert, as they were getting
their coats, hats and umbrellas from the schoolroom
closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickity grasshoppers, I should say so!”
cried Bert, crowding to the one window in the
coatroom, already filled with boys and girls
eager to escape from school. “It’s bouncing up
from the sidewalk something awful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know one thing,” announced Charlie
Mason, pushing his face against the windowglass
until his nose looked flat. “The rain
isn’t going to bounce on my umbrella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Bert. “Aren’t you going
to put your umbrella up in all this storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope!” answered Charlie, with a laugh
and a shake of his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Nan curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause I didn’t bring an umbrella, that’s
why!” chuckled the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get soaked!” said Danny Rugg.
“I haven’t got a very big umbrella, Charlie,
but you can walk under it with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” murmured Charlie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Danny’s getting real good, isn’t he, Bert?”
asked Nan, as these two dark-haired Bobbsey
twins made their way out of the coatroom and
toward the main hall, which was filled with
boys and girls eager to get home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Danny’s pretty good now,” agreed
Bert. “And I’m glad of it. He always used
to be fighting and quarreling. Say, Nan, it’s
raining like cats and dogs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse than that!” sighed Nan. “I hope
Flossie and Freddie won’t get soaked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t they bring umbrellas?” Bert wanted
to know. “If they didn’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, they brought their little ones. I
saw mother call them back and make them
take them,” replied Nan Bobbsey. “But even
a big umbrella isn’t much good in this storm.
The wind blows terribly! I’m going to wait in
the lower hall for Flossie and Freddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; I’ll wait with you,” offered Bert
good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the older Bobbsey twins stood there,
watching the other boys and girls pass out,
the rain now and then blew in through the
open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gust of wind would send the door swinging
back after some child had tried to close it,
and the water would streak across the floor,
leaving little puddles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a regular flood!” laughed Bert, as he
and his sister waited for the smaller twins,
who studied in another room, which had not
yet been dismissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be a lot of puddles on the way
home,” remarked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, do you know what I’m going to do?”
asked Bert, as he saw Danny Rugg and Charlie
Mason going out arm in arm, the better to fit
under one small umbrella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to take off my shoes and stockings,
and I’ll wade home!” declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are not!” cried Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell mother if you do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! Won’t she see me anyhow, if I
wade home? I tell you it’s better to take off
your shoes and stockings than to step in a lot
of puddles and get soaked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not going to do that!” said Nan.
“It’s too cold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to. I don’t care for the cold,”
decided Bert, and then and there he sat down
and took off his shoes and stockings, putting
his stockings in his shoes and hanging his
shoes around his neck by the laces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m all ready for a washout!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here come Flossie and Freddie,” reported
Nan. “Hurry, children,” she begged them.
“We want to get home before the storm grows
any worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m going to take off my shoes and
stockings!” cried Freddie, as he saw what Bert
had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I!” added Flossie, who always
wanted to do what Freddie did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” cried Nan. “You mustn’t!
There, see what you’ve started!” she added to
Bert. “I knew they’d want to do this when
they saw you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t help that,” chuckled Bert.
“Let ’em if they want to, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” insisted Nan, as she saw the
younger twins sitting down and beginning to
tug at their shoe laces. “You mustn’t!
Mother wouldn’t like you to go barefoot in this
cold rain—it isn’t summer yet. Keep your
shoes on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Bert has his off, and I want to wade
in the puddles!” wailed Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I!” echoed Freddie. “I want my
shoes off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be the ferryman and carry you over the
puddles,” offered Bert, and this solved the
problem, much to Nan’s delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie and Freddie kept on their shoes and
stockings, and followed their older brother and
sister out into the storm. They were almost
the last to leave the school, on account of the
little dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down pelted the rain so hard that, as Nan
had said, the umbrellas were of little use. The
wind blew the wet drops under them. But the
children rather enjoyed it, and Flossie and
Freddie squealed with delight when Bert carried
them across puddles at the gutters, the
barefooted boy wading boldly through the
muddy water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you soaked, children?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey, when they reached home. “And
Bert—barefooted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good thing I am,” said Bert, “else
my shoes would be spoiled. I had to carry
Flossie and Freddie over a lot of puddles.
Their feet aren’t so awful wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor dears! I ought to have had you
take your rubbers as well as your umbrellas,”
said Mrs. Bobbsey. “I thought we had had
enough of April showers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe this is the last one, seeing to-day’s
the last of April,” remarked Nan, walking
toward the kitchen to put her dripping umbrella
in the sink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your feet are soaking wet—I can hear
them,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they are a little wet,” admitted Nan,
looking down at them. “I jumped over most
of the puddles, and Bert lifted me across one
big one, but I guess I got a little wet, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>little</span> wet! I should say you <span class='it'>did</span>!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bobbsey. “Now all of you put
on dry things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this had been done, and the Bobbsey
twins, safe and dry, looked out of the window,
at the pelting rain, they were very glad to be
sheltered and in their comfortable home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look at the funny old lady!” exclaimed
Freddie, who was kneeling on a chair near a
front window. “She looks like Mother Goose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she hasn’t got a goose!” added Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a green umbrella,” returned Freddie.
“It’s a big one, too. Mother, why don’t
you get me a big green umbrella like hers?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid the wind would blow you away
with it,” laughed Mrs. Bobbsey, as, with Bert
and Nan, she looked out at the person Flossie
and Freddie were speaking of. “Poor old
lady!” murmured Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman making her way up the
street amid the storm, carrying on one arm
a large, square market basket covered with a
black cloth, as if to keep whatever was inside
dry from the pelting rain, did, indeed, seem a
strange figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she walked along, holding her large,
green umbrella over her head, she glanced now,
and then from beneath it at the houses she
passed. She caught sight of the four Bobbsey
twins at the window of their home, and halted
a minute, gazing intently at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you s’pose she’s coming here?”
gasped Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not,” replied Mrs. Bobbsey.
Then the old woman walked slowly on, still
peering curiously at the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she odd?” murmured Nan to Bert.
“I wonder what she has in that basket, and
what she is looking for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she sells things,” suggested Bert.
“Well, I know what I’m going to do if mother
won’t let me go out and play boat.” He had
asked to be allowed to do this, but Mrs. Bobbsey
had said no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you going to do?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to make an elevated railroad,”
declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, can you?” cried Freddie. “And may
I help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ride on it?” questioned Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan remained at the window, looking at the
queer old woman as she vanished down the
street in the mist from the rain. Though Nan
did not know it, this same old woman was
soon to play a strange part in the lives of the
Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you going to make an elevated railroad?”
asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you,” answered Bert. “No, Flossie,
you can’t ride on it,” he added, as his
smaller sister again made her request. “It’s
only the toy railroad put up on some chairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Freddie. “I’ll
help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began dragging chairs away from the
dining-room table, while Bert got from the
closet, where it was kept, a toy train of cars
that ran by electricity on a sectional track. Instead
of putting the track together on the
floor, as he usually did, Bert had decided to
raise it in the air, supporting it on chairs and
boards, thus making an elevated railroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful now, children,” warned Mrs.
Bobbsey, when she saw what they were doing.
“Don’t get hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m, we won’t!” they chorused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert had taken Dinah’s two ironing boards,
the large one and the small one, and with some
other boards and boxes from the cellar and
by the use of chairs, had made a place to put
together his tracks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can see ’em a lot better when they’re
up high this way,” said Freddie, as the track
was nearly completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could ride on it. I like to ride on
elevated railroads,” sighed Flossie. “I rided on
one when I was in New York once,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t ride on this!” replied Bert.
“You’d break it all up if you did. Hand me
that curved track, Freddie, and then I guess
it’s all done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last section of track was put in place,
Bert connected the battery, set the engine and
cars on the rail, turned the switch, and the
elevated railroad was in operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whee, this is fun!” shouted Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfully cute!” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I give my little celluloid doll a ride?”
asked Flossie. “She’s so light a fly could carry
her on its back, Bert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, give the doll a ride,” Bert said, and
with smiles of delight Flossie set her on top
of one of the toy cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bobbsey twins made up a game to play
with the elevated railroad: They pretended
they were sending loads of different things one
to the other. Bits of paper were oranges and
burned matches did very well for bunches of
bananas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, it’s raining harder than ever!” exclaimed
Bert, as he went to the window to look
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see the old lady with the green
umbrella?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” her brother answered. “She’s gone.
Hi, Freddie, what you doing?” he asked, as
he saw the little fellow crawling under the
large ironing board laid across the seats of two
chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m playing I’m under the railroad bridge,”
said Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m coming under, too!” cried Flossie,
and she crawled to where Freddie sat under
the ironing board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful!” warned Bert. “Don’t jiggle
that board or you’ll upset the whole railroad!
You’d better come out from under there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached to get hold of Freddie’s arm to
drag him forth. Just then a loud clap of
thunder sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” screamed Flossie, and she made a
dash, tumbling over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! down came the ironing board, elevated
railroad, toy engine, cars and everything, on
the heads of the smaller Bobbsey twins. At
that moment another terrific clap of thunder
fairly shook the house, and Nan cried out in
terror and Bert, too, uttered an exclamation of
fear.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MYSTERIOUS BELLS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Children! What has happened?” cried
Mrs. Bobbsey, running in from the kitchen
where she was helping Dinah get supper. She
gave one glance at the collapsed elevated toy
railway, saw Flossie and Freddie buried under
an overturned chair, the ironing board, the
engine and cars and gasped: “Oh, are you
hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another loud clap of thunder drowned, for
a moment, the answering voices of the children.
Then from the toy railroad wreck came the
faltering cry of Flossie as she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I got a terrible bang on the head!
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t hurt much—you’re just frightened!”
said Nan, soothingly, as she helped her
small sister get out from beneath the ironing
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I got banged on the knee!” exclaimed
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickity grasshoppers!” exclaimed Bert, as
he viewed the tangled mass of what, a moment
before, had been a fine-running toy railroad
system. “Everything’s gone to smash!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a wreck! Let’s play it’s a railroad
wreck!” shouted Freddie. “That’s what it
is—and I’ll be a passenger that was hurt, and
Flossie can be another passenger, and you must
send for the amberlance, an’ Nan can be a
trained nurse an’—an’—” He had to stop for
breath, he was talking so fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t need to <span class='it'>pretend</span> it was a wreck—it
sure <span class='it'>is</span> one!” declared Bert ruefully. “I hope
my electric engine isn’t smashed!” he added.
“Crawl out of there, Freddie, until I take a
look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I get a shock from the ’lectric battery?”
faltered Flossie, as Nan picked her up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bert, be careful about the electricity,
especially in a lightning storm,” admonished his
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no danger,” the older Bobbsey
boy insisted. “The wires are broken, I guess.
Who pulled that ironing board down, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Freddie did,” said Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not! You jiggled me and my head
hit it. Anyhow, the thunder knocked it
down,” insisted Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come out of the mess and clear the
wreck away,” suggested Mrs. Bobbsey. “It’s
almost time for supper. Daddy will soon be
here and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vivid flash of lightning that seemed to fill
the room with its glare, followed by a terrific
clap of thunder, stopped her from talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a terrible storm!” murmured Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the room came waddling fat old Dinah,
the colored cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am any ob mah honey lambs hurt?” she
inquired anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one is hurt,” replied Mrs. Bobbsey.
“But, oh, such a mess!” She looked at the
conglomeration of chairs, ironing boards, boxes
and the toy railroad, now scattered over the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll clean it up,” said Bert cheerfully.
And while he and Nan are doing this and while
Mrs. Bobbsey is comforting Flossie and Freddie,
who were alarmed over the storm, I shall
take just a moment to tell my new readers a
little something about this family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first book of this series, “The Bobbsey
Twins,” you learn that Mr. and Mrs. Richard
Bobbsey lived with their two sets of twins in
the eastern city of Lakeport on Lake Metoka,
where Mr. Bobbsey owned a large lumberyard.
Bert and Nan, who had dark hair and eyes,
were several years older than Flossie and Freddie,
whose hair was light and whose eyes were
blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and Nan and Flossie and Freddie were
fond of fun and good times, and they had
plenty of them in the country, at school, at the
seashore and on trips. There are various
books telling of the adventures of the Bobbsey
twins in different places, at grandpa’s farm,
on the deep blue sea, and out West. Just before
this story opens the Bobbsey twins had
been camping and had had some wonderful
adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bert, was anything broken?” asked
his mother, when the “mess,” as she called it,
of the elevated railroad had been cleared away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nothing much, Mother,” he answered.
“One of the cars lost a wheel, but that’s always
coming off. I guess Sam can fix it.” Sam
was Dinah’s husband, a jolly, stout, colored
man-of-all-work about the Bobbsey place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’d better wash now and get
ready for supper,” his mother told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could put on my bathing suit and stand
out in the rain I wouldn’t have to wash—the
shower would wash me,” Bert said, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, could we do that? Could we put on our
bathing suits?” begged Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please!” begged Flossie, who was all over
her crying spell caused by having been hit on
the head when the ironing board fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed!” laughed Mrs. Bobbsey. “This
isn’t summer yet. The rain is a cold one. I
hope your father doesn’t get drenched. But
what made your elevated railroad fall, Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess Flossie or Freddie moved one
of the chairs when they crawled under the
ironing board to make believe they were under
a bridge,” the boy answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t!” asserted Freddie. “It was the
thunder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe it was,” admitted Bert. “It
rumbled terribly loud, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” exclaimed Nan suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! is it going to thunder again?” cried
Flossie, getting ready to bury her head in
Nan’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I think I heard daddy come in,”
said the older Bobbsey girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there he is!” cried Bert, and a moment
later Mr. Bobbsey, his face sparkling with rain
drops that had blown beneath his umbrella,
entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All safe and sound?” he asked cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” his wife answered. “But if you had
been here a little while ago—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my elevated railroad was wrecked!”
laughed Bert, and by turns the children told of
the happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy,” began Nan a little later, as they
sat at the supper table, the storm having quieted
somewhat. “Daddy—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Nan?” he answered. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see a funny old lady with a green
umbrella out in the storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this—a riddle?” and Mr. Bobbsey
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! We all saw her!” cried Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ she had a big basket!” added Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey looked at his wife, to ask what
it was all about, and she told briefly about the
strange woman passing the house in the storm,
carrying the big basket, which seemed to be
heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t see her,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“It’s hard to see anything in this storm,” he
added. “Is my rubber coat here at the house?”
he asked his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” she wanted to know, looking
quickly at him. “You aren’t going out again
to-night, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ll have to,” he replied. “The
river is rising with so much rain, and I have
men moving back some of the lumber so it
won’t be washed away. But I’ll not be gone
longer than I can help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bobbsey twins were disappointed that
their father could not remain indoors with
them and tell stories this stormy night. But,
as he explained, it was needful that he look
after his lumber, many great piles of which
were on the very brink of the river that flowed
into Lake Metoka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I started men moving back some of the
piles before I left to come home to supper,” he
said. “I want to go back and find out how
much more is left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I come with you?” Bert begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m afraid not, little man,” his father
answered. “You couldn’t do anything in the
darkness, and you’d only be in the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I go down to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. I’ll see about it,” promised Mr.
Bobbsey. He put on his big rubber coat and
went out into the storm after supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder and lightning seemed to have
passed over, but it was still raining hard. Mrs.
Bobbsey let the younger twins stay up a bit later
than usual, but at last their nodding heads
showed her it was time they went to bed. Bert
and Nan soon followed and Mrs. Bobbsey sat
down to read until her husband should return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind howled mournfully through the
trees, dashing the rain against the windows,
and, more than once, Mrs. Bobbsey looked up
and shivered a little as she thought of her husband
out in the storm, trying to save his lumber
from being washed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That poor old woman, too,” mused Mrs.
Bobbsey, as she thought of the one with the
green umbrella. “She looked friendless and
forlorn. I hope she finds shelter for the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept on with her reading. Presently
there was a rumble of thunder, not so loud,
however, but that Mrs. Bobbsey heard the
ringing of the front doorbell at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder who that is at this time of night,
and out in all this storm,” she said to herself,
as she arose and walked through the front hall.
Before she reached the door she heard the patter
of bare feet in the upper hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, did you hear the bell ring?”
asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it! I haven’t been asleep yet,”
called Flossie. “Is that daddy come home? I
want to kiss him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it can’t be your father—he has a key,”
said Mrs. Bobbsey. “Go back to bed this
instant, children! You’ll catch cold in your
nighties! Go back to bed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie and Freddie did so, though they
did not want to. Mrs. Bobbsey went to the
front door. There was an electric lamp outside,
which she could light by pushing a button
within the hall. This she did and glanced out
before opening the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to her surprise, she saw no one standing
on the steps. The rain was running down the
glass in little streams, but no one could be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s strange,” mused Mrs. Bobbsey.
“I’m sure I heard the bell ring—and so did the
children. Perhaps it was some one who made
a mistake and got the wrong house, and after
they saw the number they walked away. My,
how it rains!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went back to her reading. Again came
the distant rumble of thunder, following a
flash of lightning. And, again, the doorbell
tinkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be some one!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bobbsey, and, she said afterward, she had a
“queer feeling” as she again arose and went to
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she had a chance to switch on the
light and look out she once more heard the
patter of bare feet in the upper hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flossie—Freddie—you mustn’t get out of
bed again!” she called up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t Flossie or Freddie—it’s me,”
said Bert, in a low voice. “I mean it’s I,” he
added, as he recollected that his teacher had
corrected him for saying that in class. “Who’s
ringing the bell, Mother?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I’m going to find out,”
answered Mrs. Bobbsey. But when, once
more, she looked out on the rain-swept porch
she saw no one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is certainly queer!” she exclaimed.
“Did you hear the bell, Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mother, I sure did. I thought it was
dad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is no one here,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Not a soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, maybe the lightning rang the bell,”
said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does lightning ever do such things?” Mrs.
Bobbsey wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Bert. “We had a lesson
on electricity in class the other day—not much,
just a little one—and teacher said it did funny
things. I guess it could ring a doorbell without
anybody being near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it could,” admitted Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Certainly no one is here. Better
get back to bed, Bert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a noise was heard at the back door.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BABY MAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bert Bobbsey did not go back to bed right
away. Instead, he remained in the upper hall,
listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear that, Mother?” he asked, in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that noise at the back door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan came tiptoeing out of her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she whispered. “What is the
bell ringing for, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” cautioned Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then their fears came to a sudden end, for
the voice of Mr. Bobbsey was heard in the
kitchen asking:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you, Mary? I forgot my front-door
key, and came in the back way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know the back door was open,”
remarked Mrs. Bobbsey, while Bert, no longer
worried, said to Nan:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right. It’s dad. I’m going back to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Nan. “All right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two older Bobbsey twins went to their
rooms. Flossie and Freddie had gone back to
their beds and were now slumbering peacefully,
lulled by the patter of rain drops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get in the back door if it
was locked?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband,
as he took off his dripping rubber coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always leave an extra back-door key out
over the side window ledge,” he answered, “so
if I forget my latch key I can get in. That’s
what I did to-night. But what were you doing
in the front hall?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The front doorbell rang,” his wife replied.
“Was it you ringing it?” she went on quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ring the front doorbell? No,” Mr. Bobbsey
answered. “I thought you might be
asleep and I didn’t want to disturb you. So
when I felt in my pocket and found I hadn’t
my key—on account of changing my wet trousers
for dry ones before supper—I just went
to the back door and let myself in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very strange,” said Mrs. Bobbsey, listening
to make sure that none of the twins was
stirring upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is strange?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way the front doorbell rang. Twice!
And each time I looked out I saw no one. If
you didn’t ring it, who did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you heard something rattling because
of the heavy thunder,” suggested Mr.
Bobbsey. “The knives and forks in the pantry,
maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it was the bell,” his wife insisted.
“The children heard it upstairs and came out in
their nighties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” mused Mr. Bobbsey. “I’ll take a
look out myself. It couldn’t be any boys playing
pranks on a night like this, could it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly, I should think,” his wife said.
“But the bell certainly rang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey looked through the glass of the
door—he did not open it because the rain would
have blown in—but he came out of the hall,
as his wife had done, without having seen any
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one there,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could the lightning have made the bell
ring? You know it’s an electric bell,” suggested
Mrs. Bobbsey. “Bert said it might do
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” admitted her husband. “I’ll take
a look at the bell in the morning. It may be
that it is so sensitive that the least jar of
thunder will make it ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you save the lumber?” his wife asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All but a few planks that got away from
us. The river and lake are very high. We’ve
had a lot of rain this spring. Now I think
I’ll eat something and go to bed. Looks as if
the rain would keep up into May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” agreed the twins’ mother.
“To-morrow is the first of May, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband nodded as he sat down to a
lunch she made ready for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still raining when Mr. and Mrs.
Bobbsey went to bed. But it stopped some time
during the night, and when the Bobbsey twins
awakened in the morning the sun was shining
bright and warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray!” cried Bert, as he looked from his
window. “It’s cleared off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s a big lake in the back lot!”
shouted Freddie. “I can see it from my window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll sail boats there after school,” decided
Bert, as he began to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we can make a raft and ride on it,”
proposed Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I have a ride?” begged Flossie. “You
wouldn’t let me ride on the elevated railroad.
Will you let me ride on the raft?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t made yet!” laughed Bert. “We’ll
see about it after school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a lovely day after the rain,”
said Nan, as she went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, children, get your breakfast and be
ready for school,” called Mrs. Bobbsey. “I
guess you won’t need to take umbrellas to-day,”
she added, with a laugh. “I never saw the sun
so bright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will soon dry up the puddles,” observed
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it doesn’t dry ’em all up,” ventured
Bert. “We want to have some fun in the back
lots.” Near the Bobbsey home were vacant
lots that sometimes filled with rain water and
became miniature lakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nan sat down to breakfast she suddenly
looked up and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” mumbled Bert, his
mouth half full of bread. “Do you think it’s
thundering again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! But I thought I heard a cat crying,”
answered Nan. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all kept quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, faintly, came a little wailing cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s a kittie!” exclaimed Flossie. “It’s
a kittie on the back steps! I’m going to get
it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to get down from her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cry came from the front door,” said
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” agreed his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does sound like a cat,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Perhaps some one’s pet wandered away
in the storm last night. But I don’t believe it
rang the doorbell,” she added, with a faint
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that was the lightning,” insisted Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan had hurried to the front of the house.
They heard her open the door, and the next
moment she uttered a startled cry—almost a
cry of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” called Mrs. Bobbsey. “What
is it, Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother, come quick!” exclaimed Nan.
“There’s a basket here! A basket—and it
has—it has a baby in it! Oh, a little baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other Bobbsey twins hurried to the front
door, followed by their father and mother.
They saw Nan bending over a large, square,
market basket that rested in the shelter of the
doorway, off to one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan had folded back the heavy cloth cover
of the basket. And there, nestled in a warm
blanket and looking up at the Bobbseys, was a
dear, sweet, cute, little baby, about a year old.
It had blue eyes, golden curls, and as it kicked
its tiny feet and moved its tiny hands it smiled
up at the faces bending over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my goodness! A baby! A darling
baby!” gasped Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose is it?” asked Mr. Bobbsey. “Some
one must have lost it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t <span class='it'>lose</span> babies!” declared his wife.
“It was <span class='it'>left</span> here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Left here! On purpose, do you mean?”
cried her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey nodded her head solemnly.
Nan had stooped over and was lifting the tiny
creature from its nest in the basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother! may we keep it?” begged
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a boy or a girl?” demanded Freddie.
“If it’s a boy, keep it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring it in, Nan,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“The poor little dear! It must be almost perished
with the cold—and hungry, too! Tell
Dinah to warm some milk. Oh, what a darling
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned over and kissed the soft, roselike
cheek as the baby nestled in the warm blankets
on Nan’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum! A <span class='it'>baby</span>! I thought it was going to
be a <span class='it'>cat</span>!” murmured Bert, as he picked up the
basket. “Say!” he cried suddenly. “Look
here! I know this basket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do?” exclaimed his father, with much
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Look, Nan! It’s the basket the queer
old lady with the green umbrella was carrying
in the storm yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” agreed Nan. “Oh, Mother! what
does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” was the answer, “except
that it seems to mean some one has abandoned
this baby. Oh, it’s so sweet—a regular doll!
Dinah, hurry with that warm milk!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m! Ah’s a hurryin, as fast as Ah kin!
Oh, fo’ de landest sakes! A honey lamb baby!
Oh, mah goodness! who done left it yeah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what we don’t know, Dinah. Nan
found it on the steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was a kitten,” said Nan, as she
gave the baby to her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it got a name?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not—at least, it probably has,
but we don’t know it,” said his mother. “Oh,
you sweet baby!” and she cuddled it to her
breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This must be looked into,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“Take good care of that basket and
everything in it. It’s an abandoned baby, all
right. And are you sure this basket was the
one the strange old lady had?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she had a green umbrella and a faded
shawl,” added Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum! The police ought to be able to trace
her through that description,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to have the baby arrested?”
demanded Flossie. “I think that’s mean!” and
she looked sharply at her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no; of course not, my dear!” said Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Daddy means the police must try to
find to whom the baby belongs. I can’t imagine
how any mother could desert it, though. Oh,
you little darling!” she murmured, as the baby
smiled up at her. “It’s a dear little girl,” she
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I know a good name for her,” said
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baby May,” replied her brother. “Yesterday
was the last of April. To-day is the first
of May, so May will be a good name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Bobbsey, “I should say
it would. And Baby May you shall be called
until we find out your real name. Now, Dinah,
is that milk warm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, Ah’s comin’ wif it! Mah good
stars, to t’ink ob a baby like dat ringin’ de bell
in de middle ob de night! Mah lan’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This baby didn’t ring the bell,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did den?” demanded the fat, black
cook. “Who did den, Ah axes yo’, Bert Bobbsey!
Who did?”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WHAT THE POLICE FOUND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Dinah’s question brought back to the minds
of all the Bobbseys, including the smaller pair
of twins, the things that had happened in the
storm during the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right!” exclaimed Bert, snapping his
fingers, “this baby couldn’t have rung our bell,
and yet the bell certainly did ring!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it!” said Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I,” added Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we first thought that it was daddy,”
remarked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I begin to see what happened,” Mr.
Bobbsey said. “Bert, you were wrong in thinking
the lightning rang the bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I was,” Bert admitted. “It was
the old lady with the green umbrella and the
faded shawl who carried the basket with this
baby in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother!” gasped Nan. “Do you think
she had the baby in the basket all the while—in
the rain—while she was going past our house
in the afternoon? Do you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the queer old woman rang our bell,”
went on Mr. Bobbsey. “She must have seen
you children at the window when she passed
earlier in the afternoon. She had made up her
mind to abandon the baby—that is, leave it on
some doorstep—and when she saw children
here she must have said to herself that there
was a kind mother here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there is!” cried Bert, looking lovingly
at his mother. “The best in the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear,” murmured Mrs. Bobbsey
softly, as she cuddled Baby May and fed
her warm milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” went on Mr. Bobbsey, “when the queer
old woman with the green umbrella saw there
were children here, she waited until it was dark
enough for her to leave the baby in the basket
and then she hurried away. That’s what she
did. She put the baby on the steps, rang the
bell, and ran away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the reason I didn’t see any one when
I looked through the glass door,” remarked
Mrs. Bobbsey. “The old lady was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you see the baby in the basket,
either?” asked Flossie, putting her littlest finger
softly on the roselike cheek of Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, I didn’t see the basket,” Mrs.
Bobbsey answered. “It was off to one side,
sheltered from the rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old lady took good care of the baby,
I’ll say that, even if she did desert her,” resumed
Mr. Bobbsey. “After she had rung the
bell the first time, she watched, and when she
saw that you didn’t open the door, she rang it
a second time. Then she must have gone away,
feeling sure you would come and take the baby
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we didn’t!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“The poor little dear was out in the rain all
night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she was warmly wrapped up,” Mr.
Bobbsey said. “And she must have been well
fed, for she didn’t cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she did, we didn’t hear her,” his wife
remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m glad we found Baby May; aren’t
you, Mother?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey looked at her husband and the
two exchanged strange glances, though they
could not help smiling. Mrs. Bobbsey was already
bringing up two sets of twins, and perhaps
she did not care to start in with a strange,
new baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no woman could help loving sweet Baby
May, and the manner in which Mrs. Bobbsey
leaned over and kissed the soft cheek showed
how tender was her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all the breakfast she’s going to
have?” asked Freddie, as he saw the infant
turn away from the milk. “I want a lot more
than that! I’m hungry! I got to go to
school!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I!” echoed Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My gracious, that’s so! I almost forgot I
had to go to the office!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey.
“And all the work I’ve got to do on
account of the flood! Come, children, hurry
with your breakfasts—but don’t eat too fast—and
then skip off to school. Your mother will
know what to do with the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to keep her, aren’t you,
Mother? You’re going to keep Baby May,
surely!” exclaimed Nan, as she went back to
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about it,” Mrs. Bobbsey answered.
“Of course we couldn’t keep the baby
away from her real father and mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not,” slowly agreed Nan.
“But that old woman wasn’t her mother, or
she wouldn’t have left her on our doorstep,
would she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe so,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a kidnapper! That’s what she
was!” declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she was a gypsy,” suggested Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I hardly think that,” said Daddy
Bobbsey. “From what you told me of her,
I wouldn’t say she was a gypsy, and kidnappers
don’t usually leave the children they
take. I don’t know just what to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to notify the police, of course,”
said Mrs. Bobbsey, in a whisper, for Baby
May was now asleep and had been put to bed
in a cradle that Dinah brought down from the
attic—the cradle Flossie and Freddie had once
cuddled in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The police! Are you going to have her
arrested?” cried Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Not so loud! You’ll waken her!”
warned his mother, holding up a finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you going to tell the police for,
Daddy?” asked Flossie, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is the right thing to do,” said
Mr. Bobbsey. “This baby may have been
stolen by this strange old woman. In that
case Baby May’s father and mother will be
wild with grief until they get her back. I
must find out from the police if there is any
alarm over a kidnapped child. I’ll do it before
I go to the office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do it before we go to school,”
begged Nan. “I want to tell the girls all about
Baby May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey looked at the clock. There
was still twenty minutes before the children
need start for school, and he could do considerable
telephoning in that time. So he called
up police headquarters and made a report
of the baby being found on his steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any alarm of a child having
been kidnapped anywhere around here?” asked
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered the officer at police headquarters.
“But if we hear of any we’ll let
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have any of your men seen about the town
this strange old woman with a green umbrella
and a faded shawl?” asked Mr. Bobbsey, and
the twins and Mrs. Bobbsey waited anxiously
for the reply. As they could not hear what
was said by the police officer, Mr. Bobbsey told
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says none of his men reported seeing
the old lady,” Mr. Bobbsey retailed. “But
he’ll inquire of the officers at the railroad
station. They’ll call me up in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey put the telephone receiver back
on the hook and waited. Soon the bell rang,
and when the father of the Bobbsey twins had
listened a while he turned to his family and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old lady came in on the train early
yesterday morning. The officer at the station
remembers seeing her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she have the basket with the baby in
it?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had the covered basket, but the policeman
didn’t see what was in it,” answered Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they know anything more about her?”
Mrs. Bobbsey wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much except that she acted rather
strangely,” was the reply. “She did not seem
to know where she wanted to go, and when
the officer asked her if he could help her she
just shook her head and wandered off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she tell her name?” Bert inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The policeman at the railroad station says
she mumbled a name something like ‘Washington’;
but he isn’t quite sure about that,”
Mr. Bobbsey reported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we could call the baby May Washington,”
mused Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we could,” her mother said. “Is that
all the police found out?” she inquired of her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all,” he said. “They are going to
try, however, to find the strange old lady and
ask her why she deserted the baby. But we’ll
have to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you children will have to go to
school!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, glancing at
the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ll keep Baby May Washington
until we come home, won’t you, Mother?”
pleaded Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do!” begged Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see,” murmured Mrs. Bobbsey, as the
twins hurried on to school, and Freddie said
to Bert:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like her better if she was a boy baby.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NAN WHISPERS IN SCHOOL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Richard, what do you think of the
latest member of the family?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a dear, sweet little thing, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey did not finish what he started
to say. He and his wife were bending over
and looking at the sleeping baby—May Washington,
as she had been hastily named. The
Bobbsey twins had gone to school and the
house was quiet—just the place for a sleeping
baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand how any mother would
leave such a little, helpless baby like this out
in a storm all night,” went on Mr. Bobbsey,
as he prepared to go down to his lumberyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it wasn’t the mother,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Certainly that woman seemed too
old to be the mother of a little baby like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe she was the mother,” declared
Mr. Bobbsey, looking for his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think she was the kidnapper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to think. I’ll have another
talk with the police to-day. You can’t do
very much over the telephone, but I wanted
to satisfy the children a little. Yes, I’ll inquire
further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will we do with her—with Baby
May, I mean—if the police can’t find out to
whom she belongs?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—” Mr. Bobbsey turned his hat
around several times and looked inside it as
if, there, he might find an answer to the puzzling
riddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” asked his wife, with a smile, as she
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um! Well, if we can’t find out where she
belongs, I suppose the police will have to take
her, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The police!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, and
then she clapped her hand over her mouth, for
she had, in her excitement, spoken so loudly
that she was afraid of waking the infant.
“Why, Richard Bobbsey!” she went on in a
whisper, “you wouldn’t turn a helpless little
baby like May over to a lot of men police,
would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, of course I didn’t mean exactly
that,” he murmured. “But we can’t keep
her—she belongs to some one else—and the
police will know what to do with her. You
always give abandoned babies to the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you?” asked his wife, with a smile.
“Well, this is the first time I ever saw or had
an abandoned baby, so I don’t know. And
what do the police do with the babies?” she
asked. “Lock them in an iron cell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey.
“They send them to a nursing home, a foundling
asylum, an orphanage—or somewhere.
I don’t know exactly myself; but the police
know what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” agreed his wife, with
a smile. “But it seems hard to turn a sweet
little baby like this over to a lot of men, even
if they are kind, to have them take her to an
orphan asylum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they have police women, or matrons,
or something like that to look after kidnapped
babies,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard Bobbsey,” his wife whispered, as
she followed him to the front door, “I don’t
believe there’s a single police woman, or
matron, in Lakeport!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’ll have to get one then. Anyhow,
we can’t keep the baby. She will have
to go to some asylum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” and Mrs. Bobbsey
sighed. “It seems strange that she should be
left with us, when there are good neighbors on
either side of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neighbors without children—yes,” laughed
Mr. Bobbsey. “That old woman with the
green umbrella knew what she was about when
she left her basket here. She saw our twins at
the window and she knew we were the kind
to look after a baby. But, as you say, we
can’t keep her, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” and Mrs. Bobbsey
went back to look at the sleeping baby while
her husband hurried on to his lumber office.
“Poor, lonely little dear!” she murmured,
bending over Baby May. “I wonder who your
mother is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big, fat, jolly, black Dinah tiptoed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am de honey lamb sleepin’?” she whispered.
“Does she want any mo’ hot milk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, Dinah,” Mrs. Bobbsey said.
“But you might have some ready for her when
she awakens. And bake a potato for her,
Dinah. She’s too old to live entirely on milk.
She must be about a year old, I should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t she sweet!” whispered Dinah, touching
gently with her fat black finger the rosepetal
cheek of sleeping May. “Ah jes’ lubs
dat honey lamb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think any one would love her,” returned
Mrs. Bobbsey, fondly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yo’ t’inks she am about a yeah old? She
suttenly am very small.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say about a year, Dinah. But, of
course, I am not at all sure. Babies are sometimes
deceiving when it comes to age. Some
grow much faster than others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t see how nobody could go off an leab
dat chile alone on de doahstep,” muttered the
colored cook, as she waddled back to the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey reached his office, and finding
that the storm had not done as much damage
to his lumberyard as he had feared, went to
the police to learn more, if he could, about the
abandoned baby. He talked first with the officer
at the railroad station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What train did the old lady with the basket
come in on?” the father of the Bobbsey
twins asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I couldn’t say,” answered Jim Tully,
the policeman at the station. “Two trains got
in at the same time, and I don’t know which
one she got off from. I could ask the conductors,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “I’d
like to get this baby back to her father and
mother. They must be wild about losing
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” agreed Mr. Tully. “I’ve
got six of my own, and I know my wife and
I’d be crazy if one of ’em was missing over
night. I’ll see what I can find out for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you can’t find out anything,”
went on Mr. Bobbsey, “what are we to do with
this baby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” mused Mr. Tully. “That I don’t
know. I’ll have to ask the chief. You don’t
want to keep it, I s’pose?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—er—I don’t know. We hardly
thought of that,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not. Being a strange baby,
your wife wouldn’t want to be bothered.
Well, I’ll see what I can find out for you.
But I took particular notice of the old lady. I
saw the basket was big and pretty heavy for
her, and I offered to help her carry it to the
waiting room after she got off the train. But
she wouldn’t let me—she drew away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was afraid you’d find out there was a
baby in the basket, I suppose,” suggested Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon so,” agreed the officer. “I’ll see
the chief and ask what you’d better do with
the child if we can’t locate the old lady. You
say she passed your house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, twice, my wife said. I’ll go down and
see the chief myself. I’ve got to do something
about the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey had his talk with the chief
of the Lakeport police. Meanwhile, because
of Mr. Bobbsey’s earlier telephone message,
inquiries had been made of other officers, and
a search started for the strange old woman, but
she could not be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Mr. Bobbsey,” said Chief Gallagher
at the town hall, “we haven’t any matron
or police woman here, and if you turn the
baby over to us I’ll have to send to Hilldale
for a woman to look after her. They have
a matron at Hilldale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can keep the baby for a day or
so,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “My wife seems
rather fond of her. I guess I’d better put an
advertisement in the papers—what do you
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” agreed the chief. “That’s
right—advertise for the baby’s father and
mother. And I’ll be on the lookout for any
news. If the child was stolen away from some
other city we’ll hear about it. There’ll be a
piece in the papers. You just wait a few
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bobbsey twins, talking of the big storm
and the new baby, reached school. Before
entering the yard where the other children
were at play, Bert said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Flossie and Freddie, don’t say anything
about the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” Flossie asked. “I was going
to tell Mary Holmes. She’s got a baby at her
house an’ she’s always saying we haven’t any.
Now I can tell her we <span class='it'>have</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t say anything about it,” warned
Bert. “Mother and daddy might not like it.
Wait until we find out who the baby belongs
to. Now mind, Flossie and Freddie, don’t
tell any of your friends about the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right,” agreed Flossie, for her
mother had told her she must do as Bert said
while at school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care about a girl baby,” murmured
Freddie. “If she was a boy, so I could have
a brother littler’n what I am, I’d like it all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t say anything,” warned Bert.
He turned to say the same thing to Nan, but
she had walked on ahead to talk with some of
her girl chums, and Bert did not bother to
follow. “I guess Nan won’t say anything,
anyhow,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he little knew Nan Bobbsey. She was
just bursting with the news and longing to
whisper it to her best chum, Nellie Parks, who
sat with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Bobbsey twins had been delayed a
little that morning, because of finding the
baby, and the last bell rang as they reached
the school yard. So Nan had to hurry into
her classroom without a chance to tell Nellie
the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning exercises were held. The
children sang a hymn and then took part in
the beautiful ceremony of saluting the flag.
Then the different classes, including the one
Flossie and Freddie were in, marched from
the assembly room and the day’s lessons
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful day, warm and sunny,
after the cold April rain—a perfect May day,
so Nan thought, as she looked from the schoolroom
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this—thinking of a May day—made
her remember the little baby at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly aware of what she was doing, Nan
turned to Nellie and whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve got the greatest news for you!
You’ll never guess what we have at our
house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new piano!” guessed Nellie, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! It’s a <span class='it'>baby</span>!” and Nan whispered so
shrilly that the teacher heard her and looked
up in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan Bobbsey! were you whispering?”
asked Miss Riker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye—yes—yes’m—I—I was!” faltered Nan,
realizing, too late, what she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were you saying?” Miss Riker
asked, not unkindly. “Was it about the lesson,
Nan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m. It was about—about the new baby
at our house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a new baby! That’s lovely!” and Miss
Riker smiled. “But you shouldn’t whisper
about it in school, Nan. When did the baby
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night—in the rain. It was left on
our doorstep in a basket—and I heard it cry.
I thought it was a kitten—and it was a baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a gasp of surprise from all the
pupils in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan Bobbsey!” exclaimed Miss Riker,
rather sternly, “are you making up a fairy
story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Nan. “It’s all true!”
And she was allowed to tell the class what had
happened. It was so unusual that Miss Riker
forgot all about lessons, for which the boys
and girls were very glad. And so the story of
the abandoned baby was known all over the
school at recess.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE RUNAWAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, this is a fine thing!” exclaimed Bert
Bobbsey, walking up to his sister Nan when
recess was almost over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s a fine thing?” Nan wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, everybody knows about the baby at
our house! I told Flossie and Freddie not to
tell, and you let it out right in class!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I couldn’t help it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t! I whispered about it to Nellie
and teacher heard me whisper and she asked
me and I had to tell. I didn’t know I
shouldn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gosh! That’s just like a girl—telling
everything! What do you know about that!”
and Bert turned to Danny Rugg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! That’s right! Girls can’t keep
a secret!” declared Danny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can so—if we want to!” exclaimed
Nan. “Anyhow, it would have to be known
about the baby when father told the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—all right—there’s no use worrying
about it now,” and Bert walked off, shaking
his head and talking with Danny Rugg about
girls that couldn’t keep a secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all no harm was done, since Mr.
Bobbsey wanted the story known, as that
might help find Baby May’s parents. And
besides, as Nan had said, the report would
soon get around town on account of the police
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the story was known in the school, the
Bobbsey twins, even Flossie and Freddie, had
to answer many questions as to how Baby
May Washington was found on the doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan was quite the heroine of the day, for
had not she found the tiny infant crying in
the basket?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Bert, I’ll tell you what we can do
after school,” proposed Charlie Mason that
afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can scout around and see if we can
find that old lady with the green umbrella.
We could make her take the baby back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she wouldn’t have the green umbrella
now, ’cause it isn’t raining,” said Freddie,
who overheard this talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can look for her, anyhow,” went
on Charlie. “Will you, Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And maybe there’s a reward out for whoever
takes this baby back where it lives,” suggested
Danny Rugg. “Maybe we could get
a hundred dollars that way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of it would go to Bert, ’cause the
baby was found at his house,” declared
Charlie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if we fellows found the old lady, that
would count and we’d have part of the reward,”
declared Tom Carter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you can find her,” said
Bert. “I guess she ran away after she left
the baby and rang our bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed to be the case, for search as the
police did, no trace was found of the
strange woman. She had vanished after arriving
in Lakeport and leaving the baby on
the Bobbseys’ doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Telephone calls to distant places and a diligent
reading of the newspapers, failed to show
any babies missing or kidnapped. Mr. Bobbsey
advertised in the papers of neighboring
towns, but when several days had passed and
no claim was made for Baby May Washington,
Mr. Bobbsey and his wife talked the matter
over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no trace of who this child is
or to whom she belongs,” said the twins’
father. “I suppose I had better arrange to
have the police take her to an orphanage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—” began Mrs. Bobbsey slowly, but
she was interrupted by a chorus of cries from
the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t send the baby away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us keep her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wheel her in my carriage that I don’t
use any more,” offered Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like her a little—even if she isn’t a boy!”
faltered Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Mother, let us keep her! Mayn’t
we, Daddy?” begged Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a cute little thing,” murmured Bert.
“Hey, Mother! Look! Nan’s taking her out
of the cradle!” And Nan was doing just this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! don’t you think I know how to hold
a baby?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might if you had a net under you,
like the man in the circus, so she wouldn’t hit
the floor if you dropped her,” chuckled Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! you think you’re smart, don’t you?”
sneered Nan. This was as near as she and Bert
ever came to having a fuss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, children,” chided Mrs. Bobbsey
gently, “be polite, please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are we going to do with the
baby?” asked Mr. Bobbsey. “Nearly a week
has gone past now, and we haven’t learned any
more than we knew the first day. What do
you say, Mother?” he asked his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course the baby isn’t ours, and we don’t
know where she belongs,” Mrs. Bobbsey said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have grown to love the little thing,
and the children are very fond of her. Suppose
we keep Baby May a while longer.
Something may turn up then. I couldn’t bear
to send her to an orphanage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Mr. Bobbsey, with a
smile. “Then we’ll keep the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ll call her Bobbsey, ’cause she’s
going to be one of us,” added Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only she isn’t a twin!” added Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and it’s just as well she isn’t!” laughed
his mother. “I don’t know that I’d want to
keep <span class='it'>two</span> little babies, unless they were my
own. But I can manage this one very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take care of her,” offered Nan, who
was quite proud, as she rocked the baby in her
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I wheel her in the carriage some
time?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see,” promised Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can take my roller skates when she
wants them,” offered Freddie, and then he
wondered why they all laughed. His mother
explained:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baby May Washington Bobbsey isn’t able
to walk yet, dear, to say nothing of roller
skating. But it was kind of you to offer,
Freddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” he murmured. “She’d be better if
she was a boy,” and he ran out to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the abandoned baby was kept at the
Bobbsey house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I think it’s terribly romantic to have
a strange baby at your house, Nan,” said Julia
Clark, when she and some other girls were
talking about the matter one day at recess.
“Just think, she may turn out to be an heiress
to a million dollars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she might turn out to be a gypsy,”
suggested Grace Lavine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t dark enough for a gypsy,” said
Nan. “And I don’t believe she’ll ever have a
million dollars. Daddy says if she belonged
to a wealthy family the papers would be filled
with the story about her, and detectives would
be searching all over for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who do you s’pose she is?” asked Nellie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows,” Nan answered, and that
was about all that could be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There surely was a mystery about Baby
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the little girl herself, she was wonderfully
sweet and good-natured. She cried
hardly at all, but sat on a blanket on the floor
and cooed and gurgled, kicked her rosy feet,
fluttered her tiny hands, now and then smiling
at the Bobbsey twins who bent over her or
played with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will she be big enough to walk?”
asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, in a few weeks she may begin to toddle,”
his mother answered. “I don’t know just
how old she is, but she isn’t much over a year.
She is growing fast, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s suttinly de fastest growin’ chile
whutever I seed!” declared Dinah. “She jes’
seem to swell all up when she take her milk.
She suah am de mostest darlin’ baby! Oh,
ain’t she cute!” she murmured, bending over
the infant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And “cute” was just the word that described
Baby May—Baby May Washington Bobbsey,
to give her the name which had been bestowed
on her, for the twins now regarded her as one
of themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took care of her after school hours—that
is, Flossie and Nan did, for Bert was getting
too old to look after babies, he thought.
As for Freddie—well, he hardly could be
trusted to do this, as he was such a “splutter-budget,”
as Dinah called him. She meant
he was always hurrying away to have fun, and
he might have left Baby May alone to do this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So to Nan and Flossie fell the happy task
of taking care of the baby after school hours.
Mrs. Bobbsey would wrap the little one
warmly in blankets and put her in Flossie’s
old carriage. Then Nan or Flossie would
wheel her up and down in front of the house,
stopping, now and then, to let the other children
have a look at Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the little one, she would gaze about,
smile and twinkle her blue eyes and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Or perhaps she might, on occasions, say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Da!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she said either of these things,
whatever they may be called, Flossie or Nan
would run into the house or call Mrs. Bobbsey
and say, most excitedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she talked! She talked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once when Bert heard this “talk” he
laughed at his sisters for thinking it meant
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just jabbering,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t!” insisted Nan. “A lot you know!
She said ‘no’ as plain as anything this morning
when I offered her some milk, and I’m
teaching her to say Nan, and she says ‘Na’ just
as nice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh!” chuckled Bert, as he went out to
play ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, when Mrs. Bobbsey had dressed
Baby May and put her out in the baby carriage
on the sunny side of the house, Flossie came
home from school ahead of Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, I’m going to wheel Baby May out
on the sidewalk!” called Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey was busy upstairs with Dinah,
and did not hear what Flossie said. If she
had heard she might have told Flossie to be
very careful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, without her mother knowing it, though
meaning no wrong, Flossie wheeled Baby May
out in the street. The baby was asleep, and
Flossie was careful to make no noise as she
rolled the carriage to and fro. Then along
came Freddie. He had stopped to play with
some of his boy chums, which was the reason
Flossie had reached home ahead of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to get my roller skates,” Freddie
said. “Flossie!” he called, “I can’t get
the front gate open. Come and help me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Don’t make so much noise! You’ll
wake Baby May!” whispered Flossie, for
Freddie had shouted his request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t get the gate open!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll help you, but keep quiet!” commanded
Flossie. “Don’t wake the baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The front gate stuck sometimes, but Flossie
knew that she and Freddie together could push
it open. So, leaving the baby carriage with
May in it on the sidewalk, the little girl went
to help her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as it happened, the sidewalk ran a little
downhill just at this point. And Flossie,
not knowing it, did not put the brake on the
baby-carriage wheels. So, as soon as she
walked away, the carriage, with Baby May in
it, started to roll toward the street at the point
where there was a slanting place to allow Mr.
Bobbsey’s automobile to come up over the
curbstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down into the street rolled the carriage with
the sleeping baby in it, going faster and faster.
And up the street, running very fast, came a
team of horses hitched to an empty coal
wagon. The rumble of the big wagon made
Flossie and Freddie, pushing in order to open
the gate, look around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look!” shouted Freddie. “It’s a runaway!
There’s nobody in the wagon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true, and the horses were running
faster and faster as they came on up the
street toward the Bobbsey house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A runaway! A runaway!” cried Freddie,
jumping up and down in his excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Flossie thought of Baby
May. She gave one look toward the carriage,
and saw it rolling across the street, almost in
the path of the dashing horses and the rumbling
coal wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh, dear!” gasped Flossie.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SNAP-CRACKER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie Bobbsey dashed away from the
front gate, no longer trying to open it. He almost
knocked Flossie down, so great was his
hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what you going to do?” cried the little
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to get that carriage and Baby May!”
cried Freddie. “If I don’t, the horses will run
over her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” half sobbed Flossie, for she
could think of nothing else to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage with the baby in it kept on
slowly rolling toward the middle of the street.
And up the street, running faster and faster,
came the excited horses hitched to the empty
coal wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Freddie! Freddie! Don’t go out there!”
shrilly cried Flossie, as she saw her little
brother about to spring into the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have to get the baby!” he insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! Then I’ll come with you!” decided
Flossie, who had now stopped crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a dash to join her brother. There
was still time to get Baby May and the carriage
out of danger if the children hurried.
But if they should stumble and fall—</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it happened, Bert Bobbsey came whistling
around the corner just at that moment.
Bert was thinking of going fishing, and he always
whistled at such times. When Flossie
and Freddie caught sight of their brother, they
stopped running, feeling sure he could and
would save Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert’s whistle died away when he caught
sight of the dashing, runaway horses and saw
them swaying the empty wagon from side to
side. Several men and boys were racing after
the runaways, shouting, as if that would stop
them. Other men and boys dashed out in
front, waving their hats and arms, which only
frightened the horses the more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bert saw the baby carriage, now almost
in the middle of the street and directly
in the path of the runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickity grasshoppers!” shouted Bert. “It’s
Baby May! I’ve got to save her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wisely, he did not try to stop the runaways.
This was more than a boy of Bert’s age could
have done. Instead, he gave his whole attention
to getting the carriage out of the way.
This was easy enough to do if, as Bert said
afterward, you had “nerve” enough. It meant
dashing across the street, pushing the carriage
ahead of him, right across the path of the runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bert did just that! He ran as fast as
he could—faster than he had ever run when
playing ball—and reached the carriage just in
time. He could hear Baby May cooing and
gurgling to herself amid the blankets. She
never knew what danger she was in. She
liked the easy, rolling motion of the baby carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out there, little boy!” cried a man,
who was racing after the runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get our baby!” shouted Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment he had hold of the handle
of the carriage. Never slacking his fast run,
he pushed it out of danger, to the other side
of the street. There was not much time to
spare, either, for before Bert reached the opposite
gutter the runaway team dashed past
his heels. But he was safe and so was Baby
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, boy, that was a brave thing to
do!” cried one of the several men who were
trying to stop the runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” was all Bert could answer, for he
was out of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as the coal wagon team dashed on up
the street, Bert wheeled the carriage back to
where Flossie and Freddie waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who had Baby May out?” Bert wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” answered Flossie. “Mother said
I could, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you want to take her out
in the street for when runaways come along?”
asked Bert, who seemed a bit angry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t take the baby carriage out in the
street!” whimpered Flossie, half crying. “It—now—it
rolled there when I was trying to
help Freddie open the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was going out to get her,” added
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you two want to be careful,” said
Bert, more kindly, as he noticed how frightened
the younger twins were. “Come on now, we’ll
go back to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see if they caught the runaways,”
insisted Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert looked up the street and saw a man
leading the team back. The horses were quiet
enough now. They had become tired, had
slowed down, and had easily been stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all right—no damage done,” said
Bert. “But you two have got to be more careful
with Baby May. She might have been run
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be more careful after this,” promised
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will I,” added Freddie, though it really
was not his fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey was told what had happened—or
rather, what had so nearly happened—and
she decided that Flossie was too
young to take Baby May out unless some older
person was at hand to watch for danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby May cooed and smiled when she was
lifted out of the baby carriage to be fed, and
she made funny faces at Freddie and clutched
at his nose with her soft little hand, causing
Freddie to squirm, partly in delight and partly
because she tickled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days passed with no word as to who
Baby May was. All that Mr. Bobbsey and the
police did to find the parents of the little baby
went for nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess, Mother,” said Mr. Bobbsey to his
wife, “we’ll have to keep this baby a long
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care how long we keep her,” was
the answer. “I’ve grown to love her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and Nan, as well as Flossie and Freddie,
also loved Baby May, and they hoped
nothing would ever take her from them.
Though of course they agreed with their father
that if the child’s mother and father could be
found, they must have Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we take her with us when we go on
our vacation, after school stops?” asked Bert
of his mother, one morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” she answered. “But you’d better
hurry now, or you may be late for
school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to tell the truth, Bert did not hurry
very much. The days were getting more like
summer all the while—warm and filled with
sunshine—and perhaps this is the reason why
Bert lingered on the way to school. But so
did other boys and girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And perhaps this is the reason why Bert,
in class that day, did not pay much attention
to what was going on. It was the time for
geography study, and the boys and girls had
on their desks in front of them the large
books, for they were learning to pick out
places on the map of Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the big geographies were large enough
to hide behind, and perhaps you have done
what many children have done at times—that is,
you have read or written notes in the shadow
of the covers of the big books held up in front
of you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert did not care about writing any notes,
and he had none written by any other boy to
read. But he had in his pocket a piece of
tough, brown paper, and, almost before he
knew it, Bert was folding this paper into what
he called a “snap-cracker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As you boys and girls must know how to
make them I will not take the time to tell you
how it is done. But by folding his paper in
a certain way, Bert at length had it in the shape
of a triangle, with an inner fold that, when
he brought the hand holding the paper down
quickly and stopped it suddenly, would snap
out with a pop like that of a bursting paper
bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert made this snap-cracker and then he
looked across the aisle. Danny Rugg sat
there, and Danny was a mischievous fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare you to crack that!” whispered
Danny to Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will after school!” Bert whispered back.
It was safe to whisper behind the big geographies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I mean crack it now!” went on Danny.
“I double-dare you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert did not like to take a dare. Much less
did he like to be “double-dared.” He peered
over the top of his big book. The teacher was
busy at some papers on her desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly Bert raised the paper snapper as
high as he dared. Then, swinging his arm put
into the aisle, where there was plenty of room,
he brought his hand down smartly, checking
it half way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! went the snap-cracker, with a noise
like a pistol shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” gasped a number of the pupils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of them laughed out loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teacher looked up quickly from her
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did that?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want the boy or girl who did that to come
up here to my desk,” went on the teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was very still and quiet.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Several boys and girls seated near Bert had
seen him snap the paper cracker. Of course
they would never “tell on him,” but they gave
him sidelong glances to see if he would accept
the “invitation” of the teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am waiting,” went on Miss Riker, in a
quiet voice. “I want the boy—I don’t think
it was one of the girls—I want that boy to come
up to my desk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room again became very still and quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, slowly, like the little man he was,
Bert arose in his seat. He was rather pale,
for he realized that he had done a wrong thing.
But he was not going to sneak out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I snapped the cracker, Miss Riker,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bert! I’m so sorry!” was the teacher’s
answer. “Come up here and sit in the front
seat. The others go on studying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was Miss Riker’s way. She never
punished a pupil at once when rules were
broken. She wanted to think over it quietly
and have the pupil think of it, so she always
asked the boy or girl who had been disobedient
to come to the front seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert knew what this meant. He would be
kept in after school, perhaps made to write
“disorderly” five hundred times or do some
other “punish lesson.” And he was trying so
hard for a perfect mark this last month of
school! Too bad!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was his own fault—he knew that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he made his way to the front seat,
the eyes of every other boy and girl in the
room looking at him. Miss Riker did not
look at him. That would come later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five minutes more of study and then I’ll
hear the geography class,” Miss Riker announced,
and this set the laggard ones feverishly
to studying, some murmuring over and
over again the location of the Cape of Good
Hope, which was the easiest thing to remember
about Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert was not allowed to recite with the
others. He was kept in the front seat and began
to feel very uncomfortable. He wished
Miss Riker would tell him how she was going
to punish him, and have it over with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the time came to dismiss the pupils
for the day, the teacher said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may all go now except Bert Bobbsey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was to be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly Nan, with a sad look on her face
for her brother’s plight, marched out of the
room with the others. Miss Riker busied
herself with some papers at her desk. Bert
sat in the front seat. Then the teacher, looking
up, saw Danny Rugg in his seat. He had
remained after the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Danny!” exclaimed Miss Riker in
surprise, “I didn’t tell you to stay in. You
didn’t snap a paper cracker, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m,” murmured Danny rather bashfully.
“But I—I doubled-dared Bert to snap his,
and that’s why he did it. I—now—I wanted
to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” was all Miss Riker said, but there
was a strange look on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” murmured Danny, though, really,
he did not know why he said it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the room became very quiet, only the
clock ticked loudly—oh, so loudly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with a smile, Miss Riker said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bert, I think you needn’t stay in any
longer. I was going to give you a punish
lesson, but as long as Danny has been brave
enough to remain and confess his part of it—though
really you shouldn’t do a thing just
because you are dared to do it—I think, after
all, that I will let you both go home. You
won’t crack any more snappers—or snap any
more crackers—in school hours, will you,
Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m! Never any more!” he said very
earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you won’t dare him again, Danny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m! I never will—in school!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you both may go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” mumbled the boys, as they
found their caps and departed. Miss Riker
smiled. She knew this had been the best
“punish lesson” she could have set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, wasn’t she nice!” exclaimed Danny,
when he and Bert were outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickity grasshoppers, she sure was!” declared
Bert. “I didn’t exactly mean to snap
that cracker, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think you’d do it, even after I
doubled-dared you,” remarked Danny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just going to make believe, but when
my arm got going I couldn’t seem to stop it,”
explained Bert. “Say, did it crack loud?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loud? It was like a gun!” And both boys
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course Bert had to tell his mother, for
she asked why he was late coming from
school. She warned him to be more careful
and to pay better attention to his lessons, but
she did not scold. She thought Miss Riker
knew how to manage her pupils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was Friday, and when the
hour for geography study came in Miss
Riker’s room she rather surprised the pupils
by saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not take out your geographies
this time.” Then, as she saw surprised looks
cast at Bert she added: “It isn’t because of
what happened yesterday. Bert isn’t going
to crack any more snappers. But I’m going
to teach you geography in a new way. We
are all going out to Pine Hill and from there we
can look down on Lake Metoka. We shall see
little bays, capes, peninsulas, islands, and many
other formations that you have been studying
about in the geography class. Now we are
really going to see them as they are in nature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can imagine what delightful excitement
there was then! To study outside the
classroom! What a change! Miss Riker led
forth the boys and girls, and, as they left the
school yard, marching two by two as they did
at fire drill, the teacher further surprised her
pupils by saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may talk all you wish, but I’d rather
you would talk about something connected
with geography. If any of you see a brook
that looks like a little river, tell the rest
of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More wonders! To be allowed to go out of
the classroom in school hours and then to talk!
The children could hardly believe it. Miss
Riker heard Nan Bobbsey and Nellie Parks
timidly whispering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may talk out loud,” she said, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it possible? It was, as the boys and
girls soon found out. And then, how they
talked!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see a brook!” cried Nan, presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I see a pond that might almost be
a lake,” added one of the other girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and there’s an island in the lake,” put
in Bert, quickly, and he pointed to a small heap
of dirt in the center of the pond. This remark
made everybody laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see a cliff,” said another boy, and pointed
to the edge of a steep hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Pine Hill they could look down on the
lake and could see many natural formations
that, in miniature, resembled the larger ones
told about in the geography. Miss Riker had
the boys and girls name the different formations
of land and water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the nicest lesson we ever had!” said
Nan Bobbsey, at home that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dandy!” declared Bert. “I wish she’d
take us fishing some time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she will!” chuckled Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Not so loud!” cautioned Mrs.
Bobbsey, coming from a bedroom. “I’ve just
gotten Baby May to sleep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day was Saturday, and of course
there was no school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though if it was all like the geography lesson
yesterday I wouldn’t mind going to school
on Saturdays,” said Bert, as he looked for his
cap to go out to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither would I,” agreed Nan. “Mother,
may I take Baby May out in the baby carriage?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a little while you and Flossie may wheel
her,” said Mrs. Bobbsey. “I don’t like Flossie
to take her alone, as she’s been teasing to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going over and play ball with
the other boys,” announced Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then the telephone rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s your father,” announced Mrs. Bobbsey,
after listening a moment. “He says,” she
went on, “that he has to go to Menton on some
business in the auto, and he wants to know if
you two would like to ride with him,” and she
looked at Bert and Nan. Flossie and Freddie
were out in the yard playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, would we!” cried Nan, clasping her
hands in joyful anticipation. “When is he
coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather ride with dad than play ball,”
declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re to go down to the lumberyard and
he’ll wait for you there,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Don’t say anything about it to Flossie or
Freddie, else they’ll tease to go, and I can’t let
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Bert and Nan departed quietly by the
side gate and were soon hurrying to their
father’s office on the lumber dock that extended
out a long way into Lake Metoka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What to you suppose daddy’s going over
to Menton for?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he buys lumber there,” replied Bert,
who had been to this neighboring city once or
twice before with his father. “I guess that’s
what he’s going to do this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this, the children learned when they
reached the office, was exactly Mr. Bobbsey’s
errand to Menton. This city was about fifteen
miles from Lakeport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, children, I hope I didn’t take you
away from your studies or your home work,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, with a smile, as Nan and
Bert walked up to where he waited in the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Daddy! As if we’d study on <span class='it'>Saturday</span>!”
cried Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me!” declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll declare a holiday!” laughed
their father. “All aboard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a pleasant day, the roads were good,
and they had a delightful trip to Menton. Bert
and Nan were treated to ice-cream soda in a
drug store while their father did what business
he had to look after. Then they started back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drove past the Menton railroad
station Nan suddenly caught hold of her
father’s arm and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! There she is again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old lady—the one with the faded
shawl and the green umbrella—the old woman
who left Baby May on our doorstep!” gasped
Nan excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?” her father cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! She’s just getting on the train,”
said Nan, for a train was about to leave the
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see her!” cried Bert. “It’s the same
old woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must stop her! I must speak to her!”
cried Mr. Bobbsey. “It’s lucky you saw her!
I say there! Hi, madam! I want to talk to
you! Wait a minute!” he called loudly, as he
drove the automobile as close to the track as he
dared go.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN PURSUIT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Before Mr. Bobbsey could bring his automobile
to a stop, and almost as soon as the
old woman in the faded shawl was on the platform
of one of the cars, the engine tooted
twice and the train began to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s going to get away!” exclaimed
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop the train!” cried Nan. “Somebody
stop the train!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey brought his automobile to a
standstill by a sudden pull on the emergency
brake. Then he jumped out and ran swiftly
across the depot platform toward the moving
train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute! Stop! I want to speak to
you! I want that old lady in the faded shawl!”
he cried, for now the strange old woman was
out of sight, inside one of the cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out, sir! Don’t try to get on that
moving train!” cried one of the railroad men,
stepping in front of Mr. Bobbsey. “It’s dangerous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to get on the train! I want
to get a passenger off the train—the little old
lady in the faded shawl,” explained Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, sir, but it’s too late. The train’s
going too fast and I can’t stop it,” the railroad
man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as Nan and Bert, seated in the automobile,
watched, they saw the train gathering
speed. It was carrying farther and farther
away from them the strange woman—the
woman who could solve the mystery of Baby
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess I’m too late,” sighed Mr.
Bobbsey, in disappointed tones as he watched
the train disappear from sight around a curve.
“If I had only been a minute or two sooner!
But there’s no use worrying, I suppose,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any trouble?” asked the railroad
man. “Was that lady your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” answered Mr. Bobbsey, with a
smile. “I just wanted to get some information
from her. Where does that train go?” he
asked. “And where does it stop first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It goes to Brockton,” the railroad man replied.
“And the first stop is Miles Junction.
Were you thinking of trying to catch up to it
in your auto?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. But I think I will send a telegram
to the conductor and ask him about the old
woman. He’ll surely be able to pick her out
from the other passengers. I want to get her
name and address so I can talk to her. There is
something of great importance I want to ask
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a good idea to telegraph on
ahead to the conductor,” said the railroad man.
“The train dispatcher will do the telegraphing
for you. The conductor’s name is Jerry Simpson.
The old woman didn’t rob you, or anything
like that, did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” laughed Mr. Bobbsey. “Nothing
like that!” But he did not tell why he wanted
to find out who she was. There was no need
of mentioning Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, Daddy?” asked
Bert, as his father returned to the automobile,
the engine of which was still running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey told the children his plans, adding:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I am waiting for the train conductor
to telegraph back to me, I’ll make some inquiries
around here to see if I can find out
anything about the old woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And shall we have dinner when we get
back home?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinner! Good gracious! Here it is nearly
noon!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey, looking at his
watch. “Well, we can get a lunch here while
waiting for an answer to my telegram. And I
guess I’d better telephone your mother to let
her know we shall be delayed. This is the first
chance I’ve had to get on the trail of the
strange old woman, and I don’t want to miss
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey sent a telegram to Miles Junction
for Jerry Simpson, conductor of the train,
asking him to wire back the name and address
of the old woman in the faded shawl. She
did not have the green umbrella with her this
time, and of course the big basket, in which
Baby May had been left, was at the Bobbsey
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his telegram Mr. Bobbsey asked the conductor
to send word back in care of the train
dispatcher at Menton. This having been done,
the twins’ father began to make inquiries of
railroad men and others about the strange
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of them knew her, and few of them
had noticed her coming to the station to take the
train. So his questions did not bring him
much information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must wait for an answer to the telegram,”
said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can we eat now?” asked Bert. “I’m
mighty hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m hungry, too,” added Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You certainly shall eat!” laughed their
father, and he took them to a restaurant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had to wait nearly an hour for the answer
to come back from the conductor, as the
Miles Junction stop of the train was many
miles away. But finally, as the three sat in
the station, waiting, the train dispatcher came
out of his little office, where a hundred clocks
seemed ticking. In his hand he held a paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Mr. Bobbsey?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the twins’ father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I remember you. You sent a
message to Mr. Simpson on train thirty-two.
Well, here’s his answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “Any
charge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dispatcher went back to his clicking instruments.
Mr. Bobbsey read the message to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it say, Daddy?” Bert ventured
to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she come back and tell us about the
baby?” Nan wanted to know. “Will she take
Baby May away from us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t a message from the strange
woman—it’s from the train conductor,” answered
Mr. Bobbsey. “It says that the old
woman in the faded shawl got off at Hankertown.
Um! I thought the train didn’t stop
this side of Miles Junction, but it must have
done so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Hankertown?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About fifteen miles from here,” his father
said. “Wait until I ask the dispatcher about
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dispatcher, who was also the ticket seller
explained that sometimes the train stopped
at way stations, before reaching Miles Junction,
in case there were passengers to get off
or on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s what must have happened in
this case,” the dispatcher gave as his opinion.
“The party you inquired about must have had
a ticket to Hankertown, and that’s why she got
off there. Is there anything more I can do for
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—no,” answered Mr. Bobbsey.
“Come, children,” he called to Bert and
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?” they asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to keep on after the little old
lady. I must find her! We can go to Hankertown
by auto. It’s only fifteen miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t as far as that if you go by the
back road,” the train dispatcher told them.
“It’s fifteen miles by railroad, about the same
by the main highway, but much less by the
back road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a good road?” questioned Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair,” answered the dispatcher. “You’ll
make time if you take the back road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’ll do, then,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had already telephoned to his wife, telling
her that they had caught sight of the
strange woman who had deserted the baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to make her tell the secret!” said
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Nan and Bert?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey, over the wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll keep them with me,” their father replied.
“They’ll be all right—don’t worry.
Are Flossie and Freddie all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; only Freddie fell in a mud puddle
and pulled Flossie in after him! They’re
sights, but that’s nothing new!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the baby all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, she’s a little darling. I almost
hope we never have to give her up—but of
course we must do what is right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was that Mr. Bobbsey with Bert and
Nan started for Hankertown in the automobile,
trying to arrive as soon as possible after
the train had left the strange, old woman there.
But, as the train had gone on to Miles Junction
before the conductor received the telegram, the
old woman might have disappeared again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think she lives in Hankertown?”
asked Nan, as the automobile dashed along the
country road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may,” answered Mr. Bobbsey. “Even
if she doesn’t, some one there will be sure to
know her and we can find out about her from
them. At least I hope so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, too,” murmured Nan. “But I love
Baby May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s awfully cute!” exclaimed Bert. “You
ought to see her grab hold of my nose! She
holds on so tight!” And he laughed at the
remembrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey was driving the car along at
as fast a pace as was safe, and they were about
half way to Hankertown when Bert noticed
little jets of vapor coming from the radiator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Dad!” he exclaimed. “She’s steaming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” whistled Mr. Bobbsey. “I’m
out of water! Must stop and get some right
away! It won’t do to overheat the engine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped the car, and at once a loud hissing
was heard while from beneath the car
a big cloud of steam poured out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! are we on fire?” screamed Nan.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>LOST IN THE WOODS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly, Nan!” exclaimed Bert, as
he held his sister back. She seemed about to
leap from the car, which Mr. Bobbsey had already
left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean—silly?” demanded
Nan, a bit angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because the car isn’t on fire—is it,
Daddy?” he appealed to his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” replied Mr. Bobbsey. “It
was stupid of me, but I forgot to put water in
the radiator. What little there was in there
has become so hot that it has boiled and turned
into steam. Now the steam is simply escaping
through the overflow pipe, which comes out
beneath the front axle. Here, Nan, come and
look at it, and you’ll know what it is the next
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” murmured Bert’s sister, feeling the
least little bit ashamed of herself because she
had been frightened. Then she got out, Bert
helping her politely, and looked to where the
steam in a white cloud was hissing its way out
of a small pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No danger at all, if you don’t run too long
after your water begins to boil,” explained Mr.
Bobbsey. “But I’ve got to get a fresh supply.
I wonder if there’s a roadside spring anywhere
around here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look,” offered Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’ll I,” chimed in Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” agreed their father, “one of
you go a little way up the road and the other
a little way down the road. Don’t go too far,
if you don’t find water. I’ll stay here by the
car and take the cap off the radiator. That will
let the steam out more quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Bobbsey twins separated, going in
different directions along the lonely country
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t seem to be much chance of getting
water here,” thought Bert, as he trudged
along. “It’s as dry as a desert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true. There had been no rain for
some time—not more than little showers since
the big storm in which Baby May came—and
the grass and weeds along the road were dry
and dusty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan, too, looked in vain for a spring or a
brook where her father could scoop up water
in the folding canvas pail he carried under the
seat of the automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what we’ll do if daddy can’t get
water,” Nan was thinking, when she rounded
a turn in the road and saw, in the midst of a
clump of apple trees, a small house almost like
a log cabin save that it was built of boards instead
of logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I guess some one must live there,”
thought Nan. “And if they do they must have
a well of water. I’ll go and ask, to make sure,
before I go back and tell daddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made her way toward the weather-beaten,
paintless hut, going slowly for fear
some savage dog might rush out at her. But
none came, and she opened the gate. The gate
swung shut after her. It was pulled by a
piece of iron fastened to a bit of clothesline
for a weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s comin’ in my yard?” a shrill voice
demanded—the voice of an old woman, Nan
decided, for she could see no one. For a
moment, she thought it might be the woman in
the faded shawl, the woman who had deserted
the baby. Was it possible that little May had
come from here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s comin’ in my yard?” the voice went
on. Nan felt that she must answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please, could we get some water—for
the auto?” faltered Nan. “It’s boiling
over—I mean the auto is—and it needs cool
water, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped suddenly as an old woman came
around the path that twined itself around the
house. One look showed Nan that it was not
the little old woman of the faded shawl. This
was quite a different person, in fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it you want?” demanded the old
woman sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some water, if you please, for my father’s
auto. It’s just down the road a little way,”
replied Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, water! I s’pose ye heard of my spring,
ain’t ye?” said the woman, in a rasping voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your spring? No, I didn’t know you had a
spring,” answered Nan. “But I thought maybe
you might have a well, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got a well; but I’ve a fine deep
spring, an’ the water’s as cold as ice. But, say,
look here! Did you ever throw stones at my
frog?” The old woman asked this question
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your frog! No!” gasped Nan, wondering
whether or not she might have to do with a
crazy person. “I never saw your frog,” she
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right then,” said the woman, more
gently. “Girls ain’t so bad as boys. It’s the
pesky boys that’s allers throwin’ stones at my
frog. He’s the biggest bullfrog you ever saw.
Him an’ me’s friends, an’ I never let anybody
get a drink from my spring that has throwed
stones at my frog. Seein’ as how you ain’t,
you can have all the water you want. Come,
I’ll show you where the spring is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to lead the way down a weed-tangled
path at the side of the house, but Nan
drew back. She did not exactly like this old
woman with that queer story about a giant
frog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll—I’ll go call my father,” said Nan.
“He’ll get the water in a pail, thank you. I’ll
call my father,” and she turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father never throwed stones at my
frog, did he?” demanded the old woman
sharply. Nan decided she was so queer that
she must be a hermit—living all alone in the
half-tumbled-down hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” exclaimed Nan. “Daddy
wouldn’t throw stones at any animal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wa-all, mebby he did when he was a boy.
But I’ll let him get some water from my
spring,” said the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Nan could reach the swinging gate
she heard her father calling, and Bert, too,
added his voice, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan! Nan! Did you find any water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there’s a spring here,” Nan replied,
“But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was going to add something about the
frog, but she did not have time, for her father
and Bert at that moment opened the gate. They
caught sight of the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, Bert said later, he thought
she was the one for whom they were searching.
But he had no time to say anything for no
sooner had the old woman caught sight of
Bert, than she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ho! There’s a boy! A pesky boy!
Did you ever throw stones at my frog in the
spring? If ye did—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I never did!” declared Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are ye sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” he repeated, wondering what it all
meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this about a frog in the spring?”
asked Mr. Bobbsey, smiling, for he saw that
he had to do with a queer person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my frog, Ebenezer,” explained the old
woman. “The biggest bullfrog that ever lived.
I’ll show him to you and let you get water
from my spring if you never throwed stones
at him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure we never did, for I have never
been on this road before,” answered Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman looked at him sharply, then
at Bert; and, as if satisfied that they were telling
the truth, she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wa-all, all right. Come on and bring your
blickie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My blickie?” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey.
“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pail—your bucket—whatever you
call it. I calls ’em blickies. That’s what I
calls ’em—blickies,” said the old woman. “It’s
Dutch—Pennsylvania Dutch,” she explained.
“I’m Pennsylvania Dutch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” murmured Mr. Bobbsey, making a
side motion to Nan and Bert to tell them not
to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman shuffled along, leading the
way down the weed-&nbsp;and vine-obstructed path
until she pointed to a stone-lined hole in the
ground, near a small shed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the spring,” she said. “Help yourself.
Fill your blickie,” and she motioned to
the canvas pail in Mr. Bobbsey’s hand. “But
it’s the queerest blickie I ever see. And don’t
you bother my frog!” she warned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey and the children hardly knew
whether or not to believe that there was a frog.
But when Mr. Bobbsey leaned over the edge of
the deep, clear spring, to fill the canvas pail,
he saw, sitting on the bottom, in the clean,
white sand, the largest frog he had ever beheld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, children!” he said. “It is a giant
frog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was—an immense green bullfrog,
that looked at them with its bulging, fishy eyes
from the bottom of the pool. Perhaps the
water magnified the frog, making it appear
larger than it really was, but it certainly
seemed immense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my pet frog,” mumbled the old
woman. “I don’t let no boys stone him if I
can help it, but sometimes I can’t help it. They
peg rocks at him when he sits on the edge of
the spring. An’ if I ketch them boys—wa-all,
if they do it once they never can drink from
my spring again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What boys are they?” asked Mr. Bobbsey,
as he filled his canvas pail, the frog not seeming
to be disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pesky boys—boys what go up in
the hills to take their cows to pasture or drive
’em home. Pesky boys,” answered the old
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never stoned any frogs,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must be one of the few good
boys,” said the old woman, and she gave a
half-smile, for the first time in many days it
seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for the water,” said Mr. Bobbsey,
as he started off with the dripping pail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef the children want any there’s a dipper
in the spring house,” said the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like a drink,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” murmured Nan. “Would you take a
drink from the spring where that big frog is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” answered her brother. “A frog is
as clean as a fish, and all the water we drink
has fishes in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it, Daddy?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” laughed Mr. Bobbsey. “The
frog doesn’t hurt the water any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll take a drink,” decided Nan. And
they all drank, finding the water cool—almost
ice-cold, in fact—and delicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come ag’in any time ye like as long as ye
don’t stone my frog,” invited the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The automobile was much cooler by the time
they went back to it, and pouring the cold spring
water into the radiator enabled them to go on
without further delay. Bert told Nan that,
when he could find no water on his part of
the road, he went back to the car and Mr.
Bobbsey, and then the two of them went in
search of Nan, who had walked a bit farther
than her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a queer old character,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, as he drove the machine along toward
Hankertown. “Lives all alone, I guess,
except for her giant frog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later he learned that the woman, while considered
partly crazy, was a good and harmless
old soul with a horror of boys who might stone
her frog—as, alas, many of the lads did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without further mishap Hankertown was
reached, and Mr. Bobbsey decided to begin
his inquiries at the railroad station, since it was
there the little old lady in the faded shawl had
left the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station at Hankertown was a small
one—there did not seem to be much business
done there—and Mr. Bobbsey decided that the
agent would probably remember having seen
the old lady. He might even know her name
and where she lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the twins’ father had told the
agent what was wanted, asking if he knew the
strange woman, the agent said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t say I know her. But I do
remember seeing her get off the train. She
had a shawl, just as you describe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way did she go?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.
“Does she live in the village?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say, I’m sure. I don’t know where
she lives. But she went up the wood road
after she left the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is the wood road?” Mr. Bobbsey
wanted to know. “It is very important that
I find this old woman, or I should not trouble
you with so many questions,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s all right,” answered the station
agent, good-naturedly. “I’m used to answering
questions. That’s why I’m here. The
wood road is that one crossing the track and
going up though the woods,” he explained,
pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Bobbsey and the children noticed
it—a narrow, winding road, half hidden amid
the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does it lead to?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you keep on it long enough, and
don’t turn off on any of the side trails, it will
take you to Coopertown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum—yes. I know that place. They
make a lot of barrels there,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s thirty miles to Coopertown, and
there are a lot of little villages in between,”
said the agent. “But be sure to keep to the
main road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” replied Mr. Bobbsey. “Thank
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to start on again in the automobile
with the children, hoping to overtake
the strange woman, when Bert saw a lunch
wagon not far from the station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, I’m hungry!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I,” added Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? Well, I could eat a sandwich myself,”
Mr. Bobbsey said. “I’ll get some at the
wagon, and some bottles of soda, and we’ll eat
as we go along. I don’t want to delay, for
that old woman may disappear again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bought some things at the lunch wagon,
and started once more, driving through the
woods. The road was a fair one, of dirt, but
so narrow that the branches of the trees on
either side brushed the children as they passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t like to meet a big truck now,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, as they reached a very narrow
place and squeezed through. “There is
no room to pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they met no other cars, and heard none.
It was very still and quiet in the road, save
for the chugging of their own motor and the
occasional notes of birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, it’s getting late, isn’t it?” asked
Nan, when they had gone several miles, with
never a sign of the old woman. They had
not even passed a house at which they might
inquire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My gracious, it is late—nearly six
o’clock!” exclaimed Mr. Bobbsey, looking at
his watch. “We’ve been traveling the best
part of the day. Whew! I don’t know whether
we’d better go on or not. It doesn’t look very
promising ahead,” he added, as he slowed
down the car. “We’re getting deeper into the
woods all the while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think the old woman came along
here?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to say, Son,” answered his father.
“I’ll keep on a bit farther, and then, if we
don’t catch up to her, I’ll turn back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on for another mile, and then,
finding a good place to turn, Mr. Bobbsey
did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess we’ll have to give it up,” he said.
“That agent spoke of several towns or villages
between Hankertown and Coopertown, but we
haven’t seen a single house. Yes, I’ll turn
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was getting dusk now, and Mr. Bobbsey
turned on the lights. He peered from side
to side of the road, and tooted his horn at
curves. Suddenly Nan exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, we didn’t pass that big rock before.
Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” her father admitted, as they
swung around a boulder as large as a small
house. “Whew, this is bad! I was afraid of
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we took the wrong road,” his
father replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we lost—in the woods?” faltered Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It begins to look that way,” her father,
answered. “Yes, it surely begins to look as
though we were lost!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ADVENTURES OF THE NIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey brought the automobile to a
stop not far from the great rock which Nan
had first caught sight of. She did not remember
to have passed it earlier in the trip, and
this fact caused her to think they had come
back by another road. And she was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do, Daddy?” asked
Bert, as he saw his father getting out of the
car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to look around a bit,” was the
answer. “There may be a sign near this rock,
telling us where we are. I don’t very often
get lost, but I suppose I was thinking so much
of the strange woman we are after that I
didn’t pay proper heed to the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’posing there isn’t any sign?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll wait and see whether there is
or not before we look for trouble,” laughed
Mr. Bobbsey. His laugh made Nan and Bert
feel better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was still a little, lingering light where
the trees did not quite meet in an arch overhead
in the road, and by this faint glow Mr.
Bobbsey looked around the rock for some
sign that would tell him which direction to take
to get to the nearest town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw no sign. The big rock jutted
out from the side of a hill, around which the
wood road turned, but there was no signboard
or post—nothing to tell travelers where they
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um,” said Mr. Bobbsey to himself, as he
came back to the automobile where Nan and
Bert waited. “This isn’t very pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?” asked Bert,
as he watched his father turning on the ignition
to get ready to start the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to drive on a little way and see
if we don’t get somewhere, or reach a cross
road that will take us to a town,” said Mr.
Bobbsey. “If I don’t find one within a mile or
two I’ll turn and go the other way—back
from here,” and he pointed over the road they
had just traveled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you find a road,” murmured Nan.
“I don’t want to stay in these woods all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crickity grasshoppers! I think it would be
fun,” laughed Bert. “Look, we have plenty of
sandwiches left!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He showed several in a bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it’s a good thing we have them,”
said his father. “There is no restaurant
around here, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have three bottles of soda water left,
too,” went on Bert. He had bought more than
was really needed for lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey drove the car carefully along
the road. It was rapidly growing darker, and
the lights of the automobile made two gleaming
paths through the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There doesn’t seem to be anything down
this way,” said the twins’ father, after going
about two miles. “Now we’ll try it in the
other direction from the big rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that plan, likewise, amounted to nothing.
Not a cross road did they see which
they might take and so get to some town or
village. And Mr. Bobbsey did not want to go
too far back lest he get in a worse place than
near the great stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we seem to be in the midst of a
deserted wilderness,” he said, as once more
he drove the car back to the big stone. “I
guess we’d better stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! All night?” faltered Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it won’t be light until morning,” her
father said, with a laugh. “And we’d only get
more confused and lost, if that’s possible,
traveling in the darkness. Cheer up, little
girl, it won’t be so bad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will be sport!” declared Bert.
“We can sleep in the car, and we’ve got something
to eat. Can I make a campfire, Daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I hardly think we will need that, and
you might set fire to the woods—they are very
dry. We have nothing to cook, and the car
lamps will give us light enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we haven’t anything to cook—only
some sandwiches to eat,” murmured Bert.
“But it’s lucky we have them!” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think it is,” his father said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey backed the car under an overhanging
ledge of the great rock off the road,
so that, if necessary, other cars could pass
them in the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I hardly think other cars will come
along,” said the children’s father. “I guess
ours is the only auto within fifteen miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall we ever get home?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can see to find my way out well
enough when morning comes,” said her father.
“It’s just that I don’t want to drive on a
strange road after dark, and in the forest.
Now then, let’s get ready to camp out for the
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will mother think when we don’t
come home?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may worry a little,” Mr. Bobbsey replied.
“But she will know you children are all
right as long as you are with me. She’ll guess
what has happened—that we have either had
a breakdown or are lost. Your mother won’t
worry too much, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey’s automobile was a large touring
car, and there would be plenty of room for
Bert and Nan to cuddle up and get what sleep
they could on the back seats. Luckily there
was a robe on the rail in the rear, and this
could be put over the children to keep them
warm. For, though it was almost summer,
the nights were still cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll put up the side curtains,” decided
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you sleep?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll curl up on the front seat. It won’t
be the first time I’ve been out all night in an
auto,” laughed Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the side curtains on the car it really
was snug and comfortable, and they would be
protected even in the case of rain. But they
could catch glimpses of the stars and did not
think there would be a storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for our supper!” cried Mr. Bobbsey
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He divided the sandwiches, giving Nan and
Bert the most, and the bottles of soda water
were opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a cake of chocolate, too,” said Bert,
fishing up a square of milk chocolate from one
pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night now settled down over the woods
where the Bobbsey twins—at least, half of
them—were lost. They ate and drank and
then, curled up on the back seat, Nan and Bert
listened to stories their father told them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the children asked questions or made
comments as the stories were told. But, after
a while, Mr. Bobbsey noticed that the questions
were shorter and farther apart. Soon he
heard Bert and Nan breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe they’re asleep,” he said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked back, and, by the light of the
dashboard lamp, he saw the twins slumbering.
Mr. Bobbsey pulled the robe over them. Then,
making himself as comfortable as he could in
the front seat, he prepared to pass the night.
He did not at once fall asleep, for he was
thinking of many things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer how I got on the wrong road—for
that’s what I must have done,” he mused.
“And it’s queer that the old woman in the
faded shawl would come up this lonely road.
I wonder who she is? I wonder why she deserted
Baby May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could find no answers to these questions,
so, after a while, he began to doze off. Before
he knew it his eyes were closing, and he
was slumbering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not for long. Suddenly he sat
up, he felt the auto jar, as though some one
had brushed against it, or had tried to get in.
Instantly Mr. Bobbsey was awake and sitting
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” demanded Mr. Bobbsey, in
a whisper, for he did not want to awaken Nan
and Bert, who were still sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer, so he turned on the
bright headlights of the car. As he did so
there was a scurrying in the underbrush, and
in the powerful gleam of the lamps he saw a
small animal scurrying away amid the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fox or a stray dog,” decided Mr. Bobbsey.
“It must have knocked against the wheel
and jarred me awake. It’s just as well the
children don’t know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned off the lights and again composed
himself to sleep. He was dreaming that he
was trying to catch the big frog in the spring
of the queer woman when, through his dream,
he seemed to hear a voice saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy! Daddy, wake up! I hear a noise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey sat up with a start, to find Nan
leaning over the back of the front seat and
gently shaking him by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh? What’s the matter?” murmured Mr.
Bobbsey, sleepily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I heard a noise!” whispered Nan.
“Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faintly, through the darkness of the night,
came a crackling sound, as though some large
animal was approaching the car.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>RESCUED</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Daddy?” asked Bert, who had
also been awakened, more by Nan’s voice than
by the noise in the night. “What is it?” he
inquired again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan heard something. I guess we can all
hear it now,” answered Mr. Bobbsey, as the
sound of breaking twigs, branches and underbrush
told of some large body advancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it could be a—bear?” faltered
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not,” laughed her father. “There
are no bears in these woods. It may be another
auto coming, breaking its way along a narrow
road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds more like one of those war tanks
we saw in the soldiers’ parade, Nan,” remarked
Bert. “It’s coming over everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, truly, this seemed to be the case. Whoever
or whatever it was, drew on crashingly.
Nearer and nearer to the automobile came
the loud sounds. Nan was almost ready to
scream. Mr. Bobbsey had turned on the headlights
again, but nothing showed directly in
front of their glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, suddenly, Bert gave a yell and leaped
to Nan’s side of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! It’s coming into the auto!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan looked through the celluloid windows
of the side curtains and saw, in the gleam of
the little light on the dash, the head and face
of what, at first, she took to be a monster
animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened her mouth to scream, but her
father caught sight of the animal at the same
time, and he gave a loud laugh. This kept
Nan from screaming, and also made Bert turn
around to look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a horse!” cried Mr. Bobbsey. “A
wandering horse. It has been crashing its way
through the underbrush, and now it has come
to see what we are doing here, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Only a horse!” faltered Nan, somewhat
ashamed of her needless fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just old Dobbin, the horse!” chuckled her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He made noise enough for a whole circus,”
declared Bert. “And when I saw him looking
in through the curtain I thought—well, crickity
grasshoppers, I didn’t know what to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad the horse came along,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, as the animal, after sniffing at the
automobile once or twice, continued on his
wandering way, crashing through the masses
of underbrush in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not,” declared Nan. “He frightened
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you glad about the horse,
Daddy?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it shows there must be a farm near
here, and we’ll find our way out in the morning,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so,” murmured Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better go to sleep again,” suggested her
father. “And don’t be frightened by any more
noises. Noise can’t harm you, and there are
no bears or other wild beasts in these woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan and Bert curled up again, and were
soon sound asleep, though their bed was not
the most comfortable one they might have had.
But being young and tired, they soon fell into
a sound, healthy slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again during the night Nan heard a
noise. It was the distant hooting of an owl,
who kept inquiring:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who? Who? Who?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nan had heard owls before and knew
what they were. So she paid little attention
to this one, and was soon asleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey, however, was not so lucky.
He nearly dozed off once or twice, but when he
got to thinking of all that had happened during
the day—the chase after the strange woman
with the faded shawl, the old woman with the
big frog, and how he had taken the wrong
road and so become lost—it excited him a little
and kept him awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I do hope the folks at home aren’t
worrying too much,” thought Mr. Bobbsey.
He knew his wife would worry a little—that
could not be helped. He felt that she knew
he would have sent word to her had it been
possible. However, there was no telephone
in the woods, but he made up his mind to talk
to her as soon as possible in the morning—calling
her up from the first telephone he
reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, Mrs. Bobbsey did worry some. But
she felt that the children were safe with their
father, and she knew her husband would have
sent word had he been able. Baby May was
somewhat troublesome, on account of cutting a
tooth, and this kept Mrs. Bobbsey rather busy
all night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the woods hours of darkness passed, and
at last those waiting in the automobile saw another
day coming. At least, Mr. Bobbsey
noticed the growing light in the east. Nan and
Bert were still sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I’ll get out and stretch my legs—I’m
all cramped up,” said Mr. Bobbsey to himself,
when it grew a little lighter. “We’ll soon
start and see where we come out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped quietly from the car so as not to
awaken Nan and Bert, and, walking a little
way down the woodland road, he saw a spring
of water. There he washed his hands and
face, and felt much refreshed. He also took
a long drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much of a breakfast, but it will have
to do,” chuckled Mr. Bobbsey. “I feel sorry
for the children, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Nan and Bert thought it rather
jolly fun. When they awakened they, too,
washed and drank at the spring, and then Bert
brought out his cake of milk chocolate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nan, you set the table and I’ll get breakfast,”
he jokingly said. And Nan, joining in
the joke, put three broad green leaves for
plates on a flat stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll eat,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to break the chocolate into
three pieces, but his father said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None for me, Bert, thank you. I never
could eat sweet stuff so early in the morning.
You two eat it all and then we’ll start for
home, if we can find the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy broke the chocolate into two pieces,
giving the larger one to Nan, for which she
thanked him. She was very fond of chocolate,
even in the morning. For that matter, so was
Bert, and I give him credit for being unselfish.
Not that he wasn’t a “regular boy.”
Indeed, he had his faults—he wouldn’t have
been a boy if he hadn’t had some. But he was
of a generous nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please take a little bite of my breakfast,
Daddy,” begged Nan, as she nibbled her chocolate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t want it,” her father said.
But she prevailed on him to take a nibble, and
so did Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take long to finish “breakfast,”
and then Mr. Bobbsey started the automobile,
which did not balk, refuse to go, or anything
like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way are you going, Daddy?” asked
Bert, as he and his sister took their seats again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that it makes much difference,”
Mr. Bobbsey replied. “But I think
I’ll travel back and see if we can get on the
road we first took. This big rock doesn’t
seem to be the right one. We must have
turned off the road on which we were traveling,
some distance back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On they chugged through the forest, but
it was with lighter hearts now—hearts that
were lightened by the smiling sun even as the
dark woods were made less gloomy. They
would certainly get out of the forest soon,
they felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, look about him as Mr. Bobbsey
did, he could not tell where the main road
was—at least, the road by which he had entered
the forest in search of the strange
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw several wood roads leading off the
one which he had traveled, and he tried to
tell, by looking at the marks of automobile
wheels, which was the way they had originally
taken. But other cars had also gone over
the same road, so the marks of the wheels of
the Bobbsey car could not be picked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins’ father was about to decide to
turn about and go the other way when suddenly,
from just ahead of them, came a voice,
shouting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoa there! Where you tryin’ to go?
You’ve been out all night, an’ now you want
to run away ag’in! Whoa, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds like somebody talking to a horse,”
observed Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it was the horse that tried to get
into our auto,” suggested Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, around a bend in the road, came a
lanky farmer boy, of not more than fourteen,
leading a horse. Whether it was the same
animal that had frightened Nan and Bert could
not be said for certain at once, though, later,
they learned that it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, leading the horse, advanced toward
the automobile, which Mr. Bobbsey had
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mornin’, neighbors,” called the youth
pleasantly and not at all bashfully. “You’re
out early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might say the same of you,” remarked
Mr. Bobbsey. “We’ve been out all night—lost
in the woods. Can you put me on the
road to Hankertown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Straight ahead and take the first turn to
the left,” said the lad. “You’re on the old
lumber road that isn’t used much any more.
This horse seems to like it, for he ran away
last night and I only just found him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we found him first,” said Mr.
Bobbsey, and he described the visit of the
animal in the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that was our horse,” the boy said.
“It’s just like old Jim to go pokin’ his nose in
where he isn’t wanted. Hope he didn’t do any
damage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not any,” laughed Mr. Bobbsey. “And
I’m much obliged to you for setting us right.
I got all mixed up on these wood roads. Is
there any restaurant or eating place before I
get to Hankertown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Restaurant? Good land, no! But say!
ain’t you folks had any breakfast?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, neither have I, but I reckon on havin’
some right soon. Our house is only about a
mile back, on another road. If you want to
go there my mother’ll be glad to give you
something hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t want to trouble her,” objected
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No trouble at all. She likes to have folks
to meals. Say, I believe I could sit on the
back of your machine and lead old Jim along
by his halter, if you didn’t go too fast. Then
I could be right there with you and explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I wish you would,” replied Mr.
Bobbsey. And the farmer boy was soon sitting
on the back seat, between Nan and Bert,
while, following behind, led by the long halter,
was Jim, the midnight-wandering horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s our place,” said Silas Remington,
which proved to be the name of the farmer
boy. “Drive right up. My mother’ll be
s’prised to see me comin’ back in style, I
reckon,” and he chuckled as he pointed out a
small house set in a little clearing of the woods.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LAST DAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“For the land sakes, Silas! what happened?
Did ye break your leg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was what Mrs. Remington asked as
she saw her son driving up in the automobile
to the little house in the clearing, leading the
strayed horse by the halter from the back seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been no accident,” said Mr.
Bobbsey quickly, for he did not want the boy’s
mother to worry. “We just met your son and
gave him a ride home, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These folks have been out in the woods all
night, Mother!” Silas Remington explained.
“I found them when I was hunting old Jim
down the wood road. Now if you can give
them some breakfast—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure we don’t want to trouble you,”
interrupted Mr. Bobbsey. “But I’d be glad
to pay—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pay! Nonsense! No trouble at all! Come
right in, and I’ll have breakfast ready in a
jiffy!” exclaimed the kind Mrs. Remington.
“You take the horse to the barn, Silas, and
then come in and get your breakfast, and bring
your pa with you. Silas started out early to
find Jim,” she explained to the Bobbseys, as she
bustled about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good thing for us that he did,” said
Mr. Bobbsey, “or I don’t know how much
longer we might have been wandering in the
woods. But where can I get a telephone? I
must let my wife know we are all right—she’ll
be worried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got a telephone,” said Mrs. Remington.
“I don’t bother with it much myself,
but my husband thought he had to have one.
Next I know he’ll be gettin’ a tin Lizzie, I
guess,” and she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey was soon talking to his wife
over the telephone, while the farmer’s wife
was getting breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad you’re all right!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bobbsey, when she heard her
husband’s voice. “I couldn’t imagine what
had happened, but I knew the children would
be all right with you. How’s Baby May? Oh,
she’s fine, and she’s cut another tooth! That’s
why she fretted so last night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and Nan were glad to know all were
well at home, and then they sat down to a
good breakfast. All their troubles were over
now, for Mr. Remington, who had come into
breakfast with Silas and who had a small farm
on the edge of the woods, told Mr. Bobbsey
where to drive to get back to the main road to
Hankertown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But about that strange old woman with the
faded shawl you were after, I don’t know,”
and the farmer shook his head. “I never seen
her around these parts. She must be a
stranger here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could it have been old Mary Dodd back
by the spring?” asked Mrs. Remington. “She’s
very odd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the woman with the frog in
the spring?” inquired Mr. Bobbsey. “No, we
saw old Mary and she gave us water. The
woman I am seeking is another person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wa-all, then I’m afraid I can’t help you,”
said Mr. Remington, with a shake of his head.
“But if Silas or I see the old woman around
I’ll try and find out who she is and let you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure we will!” piped up Silas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would,” returned Mr. Bobbsey,
and he prepared to set out again with Nan and
Bert in the automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bade good-bye to the kind farmer and
his wife and to his talkative son, and were soon
out of the woods and on the main highway.
Mr. Bobbsey did not think it would be of any
use to try further to locate the strange woman,
so he drove directly back to Lakeport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My, you had an adventure, didn’t you?”
exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey, when the twins and
their father arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say we did!” ejaculated Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was jolly fun!” laughed Bert. “Even
when the horse tried to stick his head in
through the side curtains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about it!” begged Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to hear, too,” said Flossie. “And
Baby May has a new tooth—she has!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we heard about that over the telephone,”
laughed Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smaller twins were delighted to hear the
account of the adventures of Nan and Bert
in the night, and Freddie declared that the next
time his father went on a trip like that he was
going too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, so you didn’t find the old woman
after all?” remarked Mrs. Bobbsey, after she
had talked matters over quietly with her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. And it begins to look as if we never
should. She is more of a mystery than ever.
I have notified the police of Hankertown,
though, and they said they would keep a lookout
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And until she is found and tells us the
secret of Baby May, we will keep the little
girl,” suggested Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you rather send her to an orphan
asylum?” asked Mr. Bobbsey, thinking
perhaps the care of the baby was too much
for his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no indeed!” she exclaimed. “I never
could give her up now, unless it were to her
real mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to know where the real mother is,”
said Mr. Bobbsey. “It certainly seems very
strange!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby May did not seem to mind being the
center of a mystery. She grew fatter and
taller, her eyes seemed bluer, her hair more
golden, and certainly her smile was sweeter.
She was a dear little baby, and every one loved
her, especially the Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summer was close at hand now. Every
day it seemed warmer and warmer to have to
go to school. With the windows open, so the
sweet wind blew in and the songs of birds
could be heard, it was quite a task to keep the
children at their lessons. Miss Riker found
it so in the room where Bert and Nan
recited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, children,” said the teacher one Monday
afternoon, as the class was about to leave
for the day, “Friday, you know, is the last
day of school for the term.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls looked at one another with glad
eyes, and the boys wanted to shout, but that
would not have been allowed. So they kept
quiet, though it was hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will have some exercises in our room
for the last day,” went on Miss Riker, “and
those who wish to may recite a piece or sing.
We will make up a program. There will be
no lessons, but just some exercises. Now,
those of you who wish to recite will please tell
me the name of their piece after school. Now
you may go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a buzz of excitement, all the boys
and girls talking about the joyous “last day”
of school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Examinations were over, Nan and Bert successfully
“passed,” as did most of their chums,
and Freddie and Flossie proudly brought home
their report cards, showing that they had done
well and could be advanced to a higher class
next term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to speak that piece about the
Indian Chief,” announced Bert, as the last day
drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m going to sing a duet with Nellie
Parks,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two children were practicing hard to
have their numbers a success when they got up
before the class on the last day of school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was in Bert’s class a boy named Sam
Todd. He was a pretty good boy—sometimes;
but he was very fond of playing tricks
or jokes—on others, you must know. Bert
didn’t remember that he ever played a trick
or joke on himself, though.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam had heard about the piece Bert was
going to speak, and just before the last day
Sam said to his chum, Joe Norton:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to play a good joke when Bert
Bobbsey gets up to speak his piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you goin’ to do?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got a lot of turkey feathers and I
fastened ’em to an old football. I made it
look like the head of an Indian. I made this
football-Indian-head fast to a string. I sit
right near the window, you know, and when
Bert gets up to speak I’m going to pull on the
string, and I’ll pull it in through the window,
the football with feathers on. I’ll pull it in
just when Bert hollers out that line about:
‘What is this fearful thing I see?’ In will pop
the feathered football, and say—won’t there
be a howl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, yes!” gasped Joe. “That’s a
dandy trick! But are you sure the thing will
come in the window when you pull the string?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll put it outside the window just before
we come in for the last day, and I’ll tie the
string to my desk. It’ll be easy for me to pull
it in. Oh, boy! Some joke! Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, boy! Some joke!” echoed Joe, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert, knowing nothing of this, kept on
studying his piece. Finally the last day of
school came. There were to be exercises in
the different rooms, more simple ones where
Flossie and Freddie were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Nan and Nellie had sung and other
boys and girls had taken their parts, Bert’s
turn came. He walked rather nervously up
to the platform on which stood Miss Riker’s
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for the joke!” whispered Sam Todd to
Joe, who sat in front of him. There was a
string running from Sam’s desk out of the
open window. The other end of the string
had been fastened to the old football covered
with feathers. At a distance it did look like
the head of an Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert started his recitation. He got along
very well, and at last he came to the line where
he had to call, several times, loudly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this fearful thing I see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as Bert started this Sam gave a hard
pull on the string. He expected to haul in his
“trick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But something had gone wrong!</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A BIG SPLASH</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Bert Bobbsey was speaking his piece so
well that his teacher and the other boys and
girls did not see what Sam Todd was trying
to do. The eyes of all in the room were fixed
on Bert—that is, the eyes of all but Sam and
his chum Joe. Bert had practiced his recitation
many times at home, his mother helping
and correcting him, until he could do it very
well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this mattered nothing to Sam, however,
if he could spoil Bert’s recitation by playing
the trick. With all that, Sam did not intend
to be mean. It was all just a “good joke” to
him and Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as was said, something went wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Sam pulled on the string it seemed
to be caught on something outside the window.
The football with its feathers, making it look
like the head of an Indian, did not bounce in
through the open window, as Sam hoped it
would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to lose. Bert was just
beginning the startling line—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this fearful thing I see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the football did not pop in now the joke
would be spoiled. As all eyes were on Bert,
Sam felt it would be safe to leave his seat to
look and find out what the trouble was. He
had a little time, as Bert had to say this line
three times—slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert gave the line once. He paused. He
repeated it. Sam was now leaning over the
edge of the window sill, looking down to see
what was holding the string of the feather-decorated
football.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Bert exclaimed, very loudly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this fearful thing I see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he did so, Sam Todd lost his balance
and fell out of the window. But that was not
all! Just under the window was a big barrel
of water, that had been used by masons when
they had done some work on the school foundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a splash and a cry of surprise, Sam
Todd toppled into this barrel of water, his
shout of alarm mingling with Bert’s dramatic
demand to know what fearful thing it was
that he saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, look at that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sammie’s out of the window!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s in the water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be drowned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was he doing anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the cries of the children ran on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, of course that brought Bert’s recitation
to a sudden end. No boy could speak a
piece with another lad falling out of the
window into a barrel of water and yelling at
the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? What has happened?” exclaimed
Miss Riker, leaping to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sammie Todd fell out of the window,” answered
Sadie Moore, who was a quick little
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world was he doing? Why
was he leaning out of the window in that way?”
demanded Miss Riker, for she had seen Sam
at the sill just before he fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wanted to—he was going to—” began
Joe Norton. Then Joe happened to think it
was hardly the fair thing to tell on Sam—to
let the teacher know about the joke. She might
find out, anyhow—very likely she would—but
Joe could not tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was Sam going to do?” demanded
Miss Riker. But no one answered her, and
from outside the window sounded the splashing
in the barrel of water and the voice of
Sam begging for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go to him. Maybe he is hurt,”
the teacher said, starting for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bert was ahead of her. He did not
much mind having his recitation broken up in
this queer way. As a matter of fact, Bert
only laughed about it afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now Sam might be in danger, through
his own foolishness, and might need help. So
Bert and some of the other boys rushed out
of school ahead of the teacher. These boys,
too, rather welcomed the interruption. They
did not care much about “speaking pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Bert and his chums reached the school
yard under the open window, they saw Sam,
dripping wet and covered with bits of lime and
plaster, climbing from the barrel of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I—now—I fell in!” spluttered Sam, as
if there was any need of an explanation.
“I—I—now—fell right in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say you did!” laughed Bert. He
could laugh now, and so could the other boys,
for Sam was not in the least hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam balanced himself for a moment on the
edge of the barrel and then slipped down and
out, over the edge. The water ran from him
and made little puddles around his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did it happen? Are you sure you
aren’t hurt?” asked Miss Riker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam did not answer the first question, but
to the second he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no’m—thank you—I’m not hurt. I—I’m
just—wet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we see you are,” observed Miss Riker,
trying not to smile, for by this time she began
to suspect that something was wrong. No boy
sitting in his seat in a quiet schoolroom, where
“speaking pieces” is going on, can fall out of
the window and into a barrel of water without
having done something himself to bring
it about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once it was certain that Sam had suffered
no more than a wetting, the teacher began to
cast about to find an explanation. Her quick
eye caught sight of the string running in
through the open window to the schoolroom.
Stepping to the window she looked inside and
saw that the string was fastened to Sam’s
desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another look, on the ground near the barrel,
disclosed the football and the feathers on it.
Then she understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see,” she murmured. “This was a
sort of—joke, Sam? Was that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye—ye—yes’m,” faltered the dripping lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. You may go back to your
seats, children—that is, all but Sam. You
had better go home and change into dry
clothes,” she added, and this time she smiled
broadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I—now—shall I come back?” asked
Sam. All the joking spirit had departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t need to come back,” said
Miss Riker. “School will be out for the
term by the time you could return.” And as
Sam, rather shame-faced, made his dripping
way toward his home, the teacher remarked:
“I hardly think it worth while to go on with
the closing exercises. They were almost
finished, anyhow. Unless, Bert, you wish to
conclude your recitation?” she added, turning
to the Bobbsey twin questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no’m—thank you—I don’t mind quitting!”
Bert made haste to say. He did not exactly
object to “speaking pieces,” but if there
was a good excuse to get out of it, he was glad
of that excuse. “I can recite it next term,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” returned Miss Riker,
with a laugh. “Well, boys and girls, you may
go now. School is over for the term. I hope
you’ll all have a happy vacation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you! Thank you! The same to
you!” chorused the boys and girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were murmurs, talks, laughter and a
general movement of relief. No more books
or studies for more than two months—oh,
joy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the pupils returned to the classroom
to get things from their desks. Charlie Mason
was beside Bert as the two boys walked
over to the water barrel to look more closely
at the “joke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Bert, I’m glad you said you didn’t
care about going on with your piece,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause I was after you, and I didn’t know
my piece very well. There’s one verse I never
can remember, and I know I’d have broken
down up on the platform. So I’m glad I didn’t
have to speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I,” murmured Bert. “Say, what is
that thing, anyhow?” he asked, as Joe Norton
pulled into view the “joke” Sam Todd had
prepared with such care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like a scalped Indian,” remarked
Danny Rugg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Sam made it for,” chuckled
Joe. “He was going to pull it in when you
said that line, Bert, about what a fearful thing
you saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Bert. “He was going
to pull it in, was he? Well, he pulled himself
<span class='it'>out</span> instead! It was a good joke all right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was, only it turned just the other
way from what Sam intended. But very often
jokes do turn that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, nothing much now mattered except
that school was out for the long vacation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going for your vacation?”
asked May Miller of Nan Bobbsey, as she
walked home with Flossie and Freddie. Bert
had gone on ahead with some of the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t exactly know,” Nan replied.
“Since we have Baby May with us, mother and
daddy haven’t made up their minds. I guess
we’ll go away somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to the seashore,” said May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been there—lots of times,” Nan
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the seashore!” murmured Flossie.
“We went there and played in the sand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Flossie fell into the water!” added
Freddie, anxious to tell all the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did you fall in, too!” countered Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we both fell in!” laughed her twin
brother, shaking his head of golden hair. “It
was lots of fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I want to go swimming in the
ocean,” said May, laughing at the smaller
Bobbsey twins, “but I don’t exactly want to
fall in. I suppose Baby May is too young
to be taken to the seashore,” she added, for
by this time every one in Lakeport knew about
the little foundling who had been left on the
Bobbsey doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so,” agreed Nan. “But
we’ll go away somewhere, I’m sure. Good-bye,
May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” May answered, as she turned
down her street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to ask mother if I can wheel
Baby May out in the baby carriage,” said Flossie,
as she and her sister and brother neared
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to be very careful, and stay
right in front of the house,” cautioned Nan.
“We don’t want any more runaways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be careful,” promised Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they reached the house and went
clattering up the steps, Mrs. Bobbsey came
softly out of the door with a hand raised to
stop them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” she whispered. “Don’t make any
noise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Nan, in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baby May is sick,” Mrs. Bobbsey replied.
“The doctor has been here, and the poor little
thing has just gone to sleep. Don’t make any
noise!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FREDDIE SEES SOMETHING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>With hushed voices and walking on tiptoes,
the smaller Bobbsey twins and Nan entered
the house. Mrs. Bobbsey closed the door
softly after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she? Where is Baby May?”
asked Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I look at her?” asked Freddie soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, dears,” their mother answered.
“She has just fallen asleep, and I don’t want
her to awaken. You may see her after she
has had her nap—that is, if she is well
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she very sick?” Nan wanted to know.
“It must have come on suddenly, for she was
all right when we went to school this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it was sudden,” Mrs. Bobbsey answered.
“She was taken with a spasm after
you left, and I had to telephone for the doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?” Nan asked, while Flossie
and Freddie, hardly breathing so anxious
were they to make no noise, waited for the
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he thought it was something she
had eaten, and he gave me some medicine for
her. After she took it she fell asleep. She
is up in my room now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anybody with her?” asked Nan. “We
got out of school a little earlier on account of
Bert speaking his piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinah is sitting beside Baby May,” said
Mrs. Bobbsey. “But what do you mean about
getting out earlier on account of Bert speaking
his piece? I hope he didn’t fail or cut
up or—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, <span class='it'>he</span> was all right,” softly laughed
Nan. “It was Sammie Todd. He fell out of
the window—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fell out of the window!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bobbsey, and then she suddenly lowered her
voice for fear of waking Baby May. “Was
he hurt?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” chuckled Nan, and then she told what
had happened. “I’ll go up and sit by the
baby,” she added, when she had finished the
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, then Dinah can come down,”
Mrs. Bobbsey said. “You and Flossie go out
and play, Freddie,” she added to the younger
twins. “But don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll play with my paper dolls—they don’t
make a sound,” decided Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll take my little cart with the rubber
tires on the wheels—that doesn’t make any
noise, either,” said Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t you give my family a ride in the
cart?” suggested Flossie. “The children haven’t
had a ride for a long time.” By children, she
of course meant her paper dolls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” answered Freddie.
“We’ll pretend the cart is a trolley car and
the children can ride on it. Only they have to
pay fare. Little stones will do for money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the younger twins thus safely amusing
themselves, Nan could spend her time with the
baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went quietly up to the room where
Dinah sat beside the bed on which little May
was lying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De honey lamb is gettin’ bettah,” whispered
Dinah. “I kin tell by de way she breeves. Dat
doctor man’s medicine done her a powerful
sight ob good! But don’t wake her up. Let
her sleep! Sleep’s de best when a baby’s sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Nan, in a whisper, and then
she sat silent beside the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby May was a beautiful picture to look
upon as she slept—a beautiful picture, but just
a little sad, Nan thought. For the little child
seemed friendless and alone in the world, no
one, seemingly, knowing where her father and
mother were. No one ever to have cared for
her save the queer old woman with the green
umbrella!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where that woman is now,”
thought Nan, as she listened to the breathing
of Baby May. As Dinah had said, her
“breeves” were quieter, now that the medicine
had its effect. But she still looked ill, Nan
thought, as she tenderly touched one dimpled
hand with a finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside in the yard below the bedroom window
Flossie and Freddie could be heard at
their play. They made only a little noise—not
enough to waken the baby. Nan heard them
and smiled, then she almost laughed as she
thought of how Sam had fallen into the barrel
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baby stirred uneasily in her sleep and
cried faintly. Mrs. Bobbsey came quickly up
the stairs and appeared in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she is waking I must give her some more
medicine,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baby May awoke with a pitiful, fretful
sick cry, and she wailed more loudly as she
became more widely awake. It was hard work
to make her take the medicine, but at least she
swallowed some, and then she cried harder
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little dear!” murmured Nan. “She
must be terribly sick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perhaps not,” said Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Little babies cry very hard for only a slight
illness. The doctor did not seem to think it
was anything serious. But he is coming in
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I take her out in the carriage?” offered
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. She must stay in the house,” her
mother answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie and Freddie came creeping up the
stairs, having left their play at the sound of
the baby’s cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she all right now?” asked Flossie.
“Could I take her out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is far from being all right,” answered
Mrs. Bobbsey. “Better run down and play
some more, little twins. Nan and I will look
after Baby May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sounds all right,” observed Freddie.
“She’s making a lot of noise,” for the infant
was crying hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All babies have to cry,” wisely remarked
Flossie, as she went downstairs with her
brother. “You cried when you were little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t ’member it,” said Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor came again that evening soon
after supper. He carefully looked the baby
over and, after sitting in his chair and appearing
to be in deep thought, he asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she ever had the jaundice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Mrs. Bobbsey answered.
“You see, she isn’t our baby, exactly. She
was left on our doorstep, and what she may
have had and gotten over I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um—yes,” remarked the doctor. “Well,
it looks to me as if she were going to have a
touch of the jaundice; she’s getting a bit
yellow. I’ll give her some new medicine,” and
he began to write on one of his prescription
blanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s jaundice, Mother?” asked Nan,
when the doctor was gone. “Did I ever have
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you had it, and you turned as yellow
as saffron, so Dinah said. As a rule, it isn’t
anything serious. Little babies often have it.
Their stomachs get out of order. But I will
need to have this medicine brought from the
drug store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get it,” offered Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go, too,” chimed in Flossie and
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s too late,” said their father, for,
though it was not yet dark, night was fast
coming on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it was not too late for Bert and
Nan to go to the drug store, which was only
a few blocks away, and out they started. Bert
had some money saved up, and he treated his
sister to an ice-cream cone while they waited
for the medicine to be prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was when the twins were on their way
home that Bert saw Nan stop, turn around,
and look back several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” he finally asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I saw some one following us,”
she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one coming after us, do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was it—Danny Rugg?” asked Bert.
“He isn’t mean any more. He used to follow
you and throw stones at you, but he doesn’t
any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it wasn’t Danny Rugg,” Nan answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was an old woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old woman!” exclaimed Bert. “Do
you mean it was the same one who left Baby
May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t be sure about that,” replied Nan,
once more glancing back over her shoulder.
“But it was some old woman. She has been
following us for two blocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute—we’ll fool her the way
detectives do!” exclaimed Bert, not explaining
how he happened to know anything about
detectives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you going to do?” asked Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll turn the next corner, and then we’ll
hide in a doorway,” Bert explained. “If any
old woman is following us she’ll think we kept
right on and we can see who she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know, like playing tag,” said Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the children turned the next corner
quickly, and then, swinging back, hid themselves
in a doorway. They waited, but no one
followed them. They waited some little time
longer. Then Bert stepped out and looked
back down the street from which they had
turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one’s coming,” he said. “I guess you
didn’t see anybody, Nan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the twins reached home with the
medicine, and told their parents about the
matter, Mr. Bobbsey said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it was the same old woman.
She doesn’t want to be found out, that’s certain;
so she wouldn’t come back to the same
town in which she deserted the baby. It was
some other old woman, Nan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it was, Daddy,” said Bert’s
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that they thought no more about it.
The new medicine seemed to be just what
Baby May needed, for she was much better
the next day. She really had the jaundice, and
her skin grew ever so yellow, causing the
Bobbsey twins to fear for the worst. But
their mother laughed at their alarm and said
Baby May would soon be better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she was. A few days later she could
be taken out in the yard and allowed to sleep
in the hammock beneath the overshadowing
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey placed Baby May in the hammock,
where the little thing crowed and cooed
in her happiness at feeling well again. Freddie
was with his mother. Nan had taken Flossie
down to a store to buy her a new hair ribbon.
Bert had gone fishing with some of the
boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De telafoam am ringin’,” announced Dinah,
coming to the back door and calling to Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Somebody done want yo’, Mrs.
Bobbsey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come right in, Dinah. Freddie, you
watch Baby May a little while, and don’t
swing the hammock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m, I won’t,” Freddie promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat beside the baby, smiling at her, for
she was so pretty and cute, and letting May
catch hold of one of his fingers. Then, as
Freddie looked toward the street he saw something—or
rather, some one. And that some
one was an old lady in a faded shawl. Freddie
insisted afterward that the shawl was faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any rate, an old lady passed the Bobbsey
house, and when she saw a baby swinging in
a hammock in the side yard, with a little boy
sitting beside the hammock, a strange look
came over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” softly murmured Freddie. “Oh, it’s
the same old woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke thus to himself the old woman
put her hand on the closed gate, and seemed
about to push it open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t come in here! Don’t you come in!”
screamed Freddie, in such a loud voice that he
frightened Baby May and she began to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you come in!” Freddie shouted
again.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A LOST BABY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Very much frightened and hardly knowing
what he was doing, Freddie sprang toward
the hammock and started to take Baby May
up in his arms. It was almost more than he
could do, for he did not know much about the
way to carry babies. But he made up his
mind to keep Baby May safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie gave one look back over his shoulder
as he reached down to take up the infant,
and he saw that the old lady, whoever she was,
did not intend to come into the yard. She
had put her hand on the gate as if to open
it, and then she seemed to change her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was muttering something to herself, but
what it was Freddie could not hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t come in here! Go away! You
can’t have Baby May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman turned away without opening
the gate, and walked off down the street.
Freddie’s heart stopped beating so fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey, alarmed by Freddie’s screams,
came running out of the house after having
answered the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Freddie, what is the matter?” his mother
asked. “You shouldn’t take Baby May up out
of the hammock!” she went on. “You might
drop her. Don’t lift her up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Freddie had ceased trying to
lift Baby May. He let her sink back on the
soft blankets in the hammock and, then, turning
to his mother, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to bring her into the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Freddie Bobbsey! What in the
world made you do that?” his mother asked.
“Didn’t I tell you never to try to carry May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want the old lady to get her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What old lady?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey,
though she knew, almost without asking, what
person Freddie must mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That same old lady,” Freddie replied.
“The one with the green umbrella, but she
didn’t have a green umbrella this time. She
had on a faded shawl and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she try to come in here and get May?”
asked Mrs. Bobbsey, now almost as much
excited as Freddie was. “Where is she?
Where did she go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t come in,” the little boy replied.
“But she put her hand on the gate and I
yelled and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard you,” gasped Mrs. Bobbsey.
“But go on—what else happened, Freddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, Mother. She just went away—down
the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey hastened to the gate and
looked up and down the street, but she saw
no sign of the curious old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure you saw her, Freddie?” she
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course I’m sure!” replied Flossie’s twin
brother. “I saw her with my own eyes, and
so did Baby May! You can ask her!” He
looked down at the cooing child as if May
could answer. But May only smiled up at
Freddie, and her smile was very sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must telephone daddy about this,” decided
Mrs. Bobbsey, after another look up
and down the street, without, however, seeing
the strange woman. “If she is back in Lakeport
the police should know about it, so they
can try to find out to whom the baby belongs.
I’ll telephone daddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This she did, and Mr. Bobbsey grew rather
excited when he heard the news. He hurried
home from the office at the lumber dock and
at once began a search of the neighborhood
for the old woman. He inquired of the neighbors
and others, but, though some said they
remembered seeing her, they could not tell
where she had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did the police have any better luck, for
though two of them scurried about town, looking
for traces of the stranger, she could not
be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is very strange,” said Mr.
Bobbsey that night, when Baby May had gone
to sleep and they were talking over matters
after supper. “At first I thought maybe Freddie
might be mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that he didn’t see any old lady
at all?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I thought perhaps he might have—well,
sort of dreamed it,” and Mr. Bobbsey
smiled at the little boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t dream it!” cried Freddie, very
positively. “I saw the old woman, and so
did Baby May. Anyhow, I don’t dream in
the daytime with my eyes open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I suppose not,” agreed his father.
“Well, since you saw her, and since others
saw her, there is no doubt but that some old
lady started to come into our yard. Whether
she was the same one the children saw just
before Baby May was left on our doorstep—that
is another question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure she was!” insisted Freddie. But
of course he was a rather small boy, and he
might have been mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the next thing to think about is,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, “what did the old woman
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wanted to take Baby May back!” said
Nan promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess she’s sorry she gave her away,”
added Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s hard to guess a reason for her strange
acts,” observed Mr. Bobbsey. “If she wanted
to get rid of the baby, why, now, does she want
the child back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to lose Baby May,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey softly. “I have grown to love her
too much. But of course if her real father
and mother wanted her I would be glad to give
her up. But I don’t believe that old woman
is her mother. Do you, Daddy?” she asked
her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied, “I don’t. I think there
is some mystery here that we don’t understand.
Though I can’t see why we haven’t heard
some news in some of the papers about a
missing or kidnapped baby. It certainly is
very strange. But I have decided on one
thing. We shall have no more scares such
as Freddie had to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you going to stop it?” asked
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go away for a time,” answered
Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away!” echoed the Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. On a little vacation trip,” went on
Mr. Bobbsey. “We will go to the country
where the old woman can’t find us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, to the country!” cried Nan, in delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Meadow Brook?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we can hardly go as far away as
Meadow Brook,” said his father. “Though,
no doubt, Uncle Daniel would be glad to see
us. But I heard to-day of a nice boarding
house in a small country town not far away,
and we will go there for a vacation trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goodie!” cried Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they got cows?” Freddie demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so,” his father answered. “So,
Mother, you had better get ready to go and
take Baby May with you,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they have cows they must have horses,”
was Freddie’s comment. “And if they have
horses I’m going to go horseback riding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why must they have horses if they have
cows?” Flossie wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ’cause they always do. When they take
the milk to the station they have to carry the
cans in a wagon, don’t they? And horses have
to pull the wagon, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ride in the wagon. I don’t want to go
on a horse’s back,” said Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were busy times during the next few
days, and then came a short but delightful
trip to Pine Hill, a little country town where
a farmer and his wife took a few boarders
during the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bobbsey family about filled the place,
and there were only two other people as boarders,
two old ladies. Mr. and Mrs. Meekin,
who kept the boarding house, welcomed the
Bobbsey twins, their parents and Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a sweet child!” exclaimed Mrs.
Meekin. “How old is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know exactly,” replied Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t?” cried the two old lady boarders,
in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You see May isn’t my child. She is
a foundling left on our doorstep,” explained
Mrs. Bobbsey. She thought it best to tell the
true story of Baby May. If she did not, one
of the twins would be sure to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another reason for giving out the fact about
Baby May was that Mrs. Bobbsey wanted all
in the house to know about the strange old
woman in the faded shawl, so, if by any chance
she should appear at Pine Hill, the alarm
would be given promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a dear, sweet baby, whoever owns
her,” said Miss Himson, one of the old lady
boarders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed she is!” agreed Miss Jackson, the
other old lady boarder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happy were the days the Bobbsey twins
spent at Pine Hill. Not only were there cows,
to Freddie’s delight, but there were sheep and
horses, besides ducks and chickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie never tired of watching the ducks
swim, and once he fell into a mud puddle as
he tried to fasten a long string to one of the
ducks. The string was tied to a boat Freddie
had made, and he wanted the duck to pull it.
My, you should have seen Freddie after he
fell into the duck pond! Oh, so muddy and
wet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Bobbsey twins had lots of fun, and
Baby May grew fat and rosy-cheeked in those
days spent in the fresh air of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Nan was allowed to wheel the baby
in her carriage to a little clump of woods not
far from the house. Bert, Flossie and Freddie
also went along, and the children took a
lunch with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins had a regular picnic under the
trees in the cool, shady grove, and played
games, having a lovely time. Baby May went
to sleep in her carriage on top of a little hill,
covered with slippery pine needles, down
which Freddie and Flossie slid. The needles
made the hill almost as slippery as snow or ice
would have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while Bert wandered away to see
if he could find a place to fish, for he had
brought a hook and line and some bait with
him. Flossie and Freddie begged Nan to go
with them to look for wild flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll go a little way,” agreed
Nan. “I guess Baby May will be all right
asleep in her carriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls and Freddie were gone rather
longer than they meant to be, and when they
returned to the grove where they had left
May in the carriage, the carriage and the baby
were gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” gasped Nan. “Where is May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Bert came back and wheeled her
around ’cause she was crying,” suggested
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, maybe! I hope so!” murmured Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Bert came back a little later,
having found no place to fish, he said he had
not wheeled away Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where is she?” gasped Nan, her
heart fluttering strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She—she’s lost!” cried Flossie, and then,
as the dreadful thought became clearer to her
she sobbed: “Baby May is lost!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GREEN UMBRELLA</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly it was very strange—this vanishing
of Baby May, carriage and all. What
could it mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” sobbed Flossie. “What will
mother say? It wasn’t my fault, was it?”
she asked, remembering the time she had left
the baby carriage for a moment and it had so
nearly rolled under the runaway horses hitched
to the coal wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, of course it wasn’t your fault,”
replied Nan soothingly. “But where can the
baby be? We weren’t gone so very long.
Bert, are you sure you aren’t playing a joke
on us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course I’m not playing a joke!” ejaculated
Bert earnestly. “I wouldn’t play a joke like
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nan believed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that old woman—I know ’tis!” declared
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s look around,” suggested Nan eagerly.
“If the old woman did take May away she
can’t have got very far. Let’s look around!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on top of the little hill, the Bobbsey
twins began to look about them for a possible
sight of the old woman hurrying away and
wheeling Baby May. But they saw no one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Freddie slipped on the pine needles
and began sliding down the hill. It was what
he and Flossie had done before, to have fun,
but now Freddie’s slipping was an accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” he cried as he felt himself going.
“Oh, I’m skidding!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had heard his father say this while
driving the automobile on a wet and slippery
pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie slid all the way down to the bottom
of the hill. He came to a stop near a clump
of bushes—bushes covered with thick, green
leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, all of a sudden, while Flossie,
Bert and Nan stood on the top of the hill,
hardly knowing whether or not to laugh at
Freddie, and when they were wondering what
dreadful thing might have happened to Baby
May, Freddie gave a loud cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a cry as if he were hurt. It was,
rather, a cry of joy. Then the little fellow
yelled:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found her! I’ve found Baby May!
Here’s her carriage in the bushes! I’ve found
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can imagine how swiftly Bert raced
down that hill. Nan tried to follow as fast as
her twin brother, but she slipped and slid on
the pine needles—she “skidded” just as Freddie
had done. As for Flossie, she started to
run, but she tripped and fell on her face. Then
she, too, slid down the remainder of the way
on the brown needles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way all four of the Bobbsey twins
reached the bottom of the hill. Bert was the
first to get to where Freddie sat, pointing his
chubby forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it?” demanded Bert. “Where’s
the carriage and Baby May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right in there!” Freddie answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert saw the carriage, almost completely
hidden behind a screen of green leaves. At
the same time Nan and Flossie saw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” murmured Nan. “Oh, maybe she
isn’t in the carriage! Maybe the old woman
took May out and pushed the carriage down
the hill!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll soon see!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dashed into the bushes, pulled aside the
branches that almost covered the carriage, and
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right! She’s here fast asleep!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, his loud voice awakened the
baby, who cooed and gurgled so that the others
heard her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wheel her out,” said Bert, and a moment
later Baby May was surrounded by the
Bobbsey twins. Everything was all right now—the
lost baby had been found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Baby May! Baby May!” cried Nan,
gathering the infant up in her arms. “Oh, if
that old woman had taken you what would
I have done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe the old woman did try to take her,”
suggested Bert. “She may have come as far as
this down the hill, and then she heard us
coming and she hid the carriage here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” agreed Nan. And then, as she
remembered how she and the two smaller
twins had slipped down the pine needle hill she
added: “And maybe the carriage rolled down
by itself, Bert. I put the brake on, but sometimes
it doesn’t hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, maybe it did happen that way,” Bert
admitted. “The carriage could have rolled
down the hill, and it could have rolled in behind
the bushes and we wouldn’t see it until
we went down close and looked—as Freddie
did. I guess maybe the carriage did roll down
by itself. It could slide easy on the pine
needles, and it wouldn’t wake up Baby May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having caught no sight of the strange old
woman, the children finally decided it must all
have been an accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brakes did not hold very well, as Nan
said, and some movement of the baby in her
sleep might have started the carriage to rolling.
Down the hill it could easily coast and push
its way in through the screen of green leaves,
the branches springing back into place, thus
hiding the carriage from view until Freddie
happened to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad everything is all right,”
announced Nan, as they started back for the
boarding house. “I wouldn’t want to go
home without Baby May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” said Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not easy for Nan and Bert to tell
their mother what had happened, but they
knew they must. They feared she would
blame them for being careless, but all Mrs.
Bobbsey said was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be a little more careful. If you
knew the brakes on the carriage didn’t hold,
Nan, you should have blocked the wheels with
a stone or a piece of wood. But I’ll have daddy
fix the brakes.” And the next day Mr. Bobbsey
tightened the brakes so they would hold better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey also went to the hill and looked
at the place where it was supposed the carriage
had rolled down by itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it could have happened that way,” he
said to his wife. “But I must make sure the
old woman is not sneaking around here. She
may have followed us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we didn’t tell any of the neighbors
where we were going!” exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Just on that account we didn’t tell them—so
if the old woman came back and inquired
of the neighbors where we had gone, they
couldn’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same she may have found out and
have come here,” returned Mr. Bobbsey. “I’ll
make some inquiries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as no one around Pine Hill had seen the
stranger, the father of the Bobbsey twins began
to feel a little easier in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably it was just an accident,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer days at Pine Hill were happy
ones for the Bobbsey twins. They played
about in the woods and fields, and Mrs. Bobbsey
sometimes went with them, taking Baby
May in her carriage. Flossie and Nan had
their dolls to play with, and many a little party
they made up under the apple trees. There
was a big swing, too, in the orchard, and there
the twins had fun all day long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert had become very fond of fishing since
coming to Pine Hill. There were several small
streams in the country round about, and from
them he had pulled several good-sized fish that
Mrs. Meekin cooked for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day Bert took Freddie off on a fishing
trip to a place about a mile from their boarding
house. Freddie had a little pole of his
own, and Bert promised to bait the hook for
him, as Freddie, otherwise, might get it stuck
in his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys sat down on the bank of the stream
under a shady buttonwood tree, and tossed
their baited hooks into the water. Fastened
on their lines were bits of cork, painted green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you see your cork bobber go under
the water,” said Bert to Freddie, “you want
to pull in quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Freddie curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cause why,” answered Bert. “ ’Cause
when your green bobber goes under it means
there’s a fish on the hook, and you want to
pull it in before it gets off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” answered Freddie. Then, after a
moment, suddenly he cried: “There she goes!”
and he jerked up his pole. On the end of his
line was a large, wiggling fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you caught a good one!” cried Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Freddie’s fish off the hook, and
then Bert caught one himself. The boys were
having good luck with their fishing. Presently
Freddie stood up to “stretch his legs,” as
he called it. He gave a sudden start and, looking
at Bert, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just saw it again, Bert! I just saw it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saw what?” Bert asked, not paying much
attention to his brother, for he felt a nibble
at his bait. “What did you just see, Freddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The green umbrella!” whispered the little
fellow. “I just saw a green umbrella going
along the road,” and he pointed to the highway
which passed not far from the stream
where the two were fishing. “It was a green
umbrella, just like that kidnapper woman
carried, Bert!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>KIDNAPPED</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Bert hardly knew whether
or not to believe what Freddie said. Of course
he knew that his little brother would not tell
an untruth, but Freddie might be mistaken.
So Bert made up his mind to ask him again
what he had said. The fish which had been
nibbling at Bert’s bait seemed not to like it,
and swam away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say you saw, Freddie?”
asked the older boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw—now—I saw that green umbrella!”
whispered Freddie, getting up from his seat
on the bank and walking over to Bert. “The
green umbrella went past in the road—the
same kind of a green umbrella the little old
woman had when afterward we found the
baby on our steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie seemed very sure about this. He
was not fooling—Bert could tell that. And
the little boy seemed somewhat frightened.
Otherwise he would not have whispered and
have come over so close to his older brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you saw a tree waving in the wind—a
tree with green leaves on it, Freddie,”
suggested Bert, to try him. “Or it might have
been a bush that you saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir!” insisted Freddie stoutly. “It was
a green umbrella.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see the little old woman, Freddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t see her. But I saw her umbrella—a
green one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll take a look down the road,”
decided Bert. “I guess we have enough fish,
anyhow, and we might as well go home. We
can look and see if the old woman is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she is, you won’t let her take me, will
you, Bert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not! Don’t be silly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she’s a kidnapper—Nan said she was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe she did kidnap Baby May and
then leave her with us; but she wouldn’t take
a big boy like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she did,” declared Freddie, winding up
his line, “I’d bite her and I’d kick her and I’d
scratch her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess that wouldn’t be any too
much for a kidnapper,” laughed Bert. “But
I don’t believe we’ll see any one, Freddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the two brothers had crossed the field
of clover and reached the highway, there was
neither a green umbrella nor an old woman in
sight—nothing but the dusty road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t here,” said Bert. “I didn’t think
there would be anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did see a green umbrella,” insisted
Freddie. “Maybe if you looked in the dust
you could see her feet marks like when you
and the other fellows make believe trail
Indians and wild game. Take a look, Bert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can look, but I don’t believe we’ll
find anything,” the older boy answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he saw the plain marks of a
woman’s shoes in the dust at the side of the
road, Bert had to admit that there might have
been some woman along there. The footprints
came on to the highway at a place where
a narrow path wound back into the woods, and
they showed that the woman, whoever she
was, had come out of the clump of trees and
had walked along the dusty road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! What’d I tell you?” exclaimed
Freddie. “Wasn’t an old woman along here
with a green umbrella? I saw it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some woman has been here—that’s plain
enough,” Bert had to say. “But I can’t tell
by these marks how old she was, and nobody
could tell if she had a green umbrella or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she had an umbrella, and she kept sticking
the end down in the dirt like daddy sticks
his cane on Sundays, then you could tell,” said
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” admitted Bert, “then you could tell.
But I don’t see any umbrella marks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither could Freddie, but he was sure he
had seen the green umbrella passing along the
highway. But it had been held up, and the
old woman was probably using it as a sunshade;
so Freddie had to admit that it could
not have made marks in the dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys followed the trail of the woman’s
footsteps in the dust as far as they could see
them. Then the woman, whoever she was, had
stepped from the side of the highway, where
the dust was thickest, into the hard, middle
part, where there were many wheel marks,
both of automobiles and wagons, and also the
prints of horses’ feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve lost ’em!” announced Bert, as the
footprints vanished. “No use trailing her
any farther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you tell which way she went?” asked
Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” his brother replied. “Maybe she
turned around and walked back, or maybe she
kept on, and, if she did, she might have turned
off on any cross road. No use following her
any farther, Freddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But we’ll tell daddy and mother,
sha’n’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sure!” Bert agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys trudged back to the house with
their strings of fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what fine luck you had!” cried Nan,
as she met them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we had an adventure, too!” burst out
Freddie. “I saw the old woman kidnapper—I
mean, I didn’t <span class='it'>zactly</span> see her, but I saw her
green umbrella and—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had to stop, for he was out of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he mean, Bert?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey, with a quick look at her older son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he surely thinks he saw the green
umbrella,” Bert explained, and then he went
on with the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey looked a bit serious when,
later, he heard all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?” his wife asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course that strange old woman may have
followed us here, and she may be anxious to
get Baby May back,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“Though how she found us I don’t know. And
I can’t imagine why she is so mysterious. If
she wanted the baby, why did she desert her
in a storm on our steps? And if she gave her
away, why, now, does she want her back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all very mysteriousness, isn’t it?” asked
Nan, and when Bert laughed at her for saying
the big word wrong she wrinkled up her nose
at him, which was as near as Nan ever came
to “making a face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is strange,” her father said, and he
did not even smile at Nan’s error. “I think I
must make some more inquiries around here.
Surely if there is a mysterious woman going
about and carrying a green umbrella, some
one ought to see her. Meanwhile, you had
better take extra good care of Baby May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly will do that!” said Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next few days Baby May was not
wheeled in her carriage very far from the
house. Or, if she was, either Mr. or Mrs.
Bobbsey went with the children who took May
out for an airing. Neither Flossie nor Freddie,
together or singly, were allowed to wheel
Baby May now, unless Bert or Nan went along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t take any chances,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey. “Of course May isn’t our baby, but
I love her as much as though she were, and I
don’t intend that some one who has no right
to her shall take her away from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Baby May was given extra care. She
seemed to have gotten all over her illness and
laughed and cooed and “talked” for she could
now say a few words, though of course she
could not put them together in a sentence. She
smiled and made her blue eyes sparkle, until
Nan, hugging and kissing her, declared she
was the “dearest, sweetest and loveliest baby
in all the world.” And of course she was—just
as every baby is to those who love children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mr. Bobbsey rode about in his
automobile, sometimes taking Nan and Bert
with him, and he made inquiries of all whom
he met about the mysterious old woman with
the green umbrella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he could learn no news. No one
seemed to have seen her. But one day, when
Mr. Bobbsey and Nan and Bert stopped at a
lonely farmhouse so the children could get a
drink of water, he got a “clew,” as he called
it. Afterward he told Bert and Nan that a
“clew” on a ship was something to which a
rope may be fastened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when you are searching for some one
or something, a clew is a bit of information to
which you may fasten other news and so, after
a while, get enough clews to lead you to what
you are looking for,” said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see now—a queer old woman with a
green umbrella,” musingly repeated a farmer
of whom Mr. Bobbsey asked this question.
“Yes, I did see such a person. She came to
our door four or five days ago and asked for a
drink of milk. My wife gave her a glass.
I’ll call her. She can tell you more than I
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Kenton said that she had seen the queer
old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She carried a faded green umbrella, and
she wore a faded shawl,” she said to Mr.
Bobbsey. “She acted queer, too, and kept putting
her hand to her head as if it hurt her.
I asked her if it ached and if she didn’t want
a cup of tea to cure it. But she said it wasn’t
exactly an ache, but a sort of buzzing. It was
getting better she told me, after she had taken
the milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she say anything about having lost a
baby or of having left one on the steps of our
house?” asked Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good land! Left a baby on your steps!
No, she didn’t say anything about that!” exclaimed
Mrs. Kenton. “Do tell! Land sakes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am anxious to know why she is acting
so strangely around here,” went on Mr. Bobbsey.
“Do you know where she lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the Kentons did not know. The old
woman had departed, green umbrella, faded
shawl and all, after resting herself and drinking
the milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, at least we have proved that she is
real,” said Mr. Bobbsey to Bert and Nan, on
their way home. “She isn’t imaginary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Freddie saw her?” asked
Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have,” admitted her father. “I
wish I knew what to do about it. I don’t want
to keep Baby May away from her parents, but
I don’t want this queer old woman to have
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Bobbsey was a bit excited when she
heard the news her husband brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Nan,” she said to her daughter, “you
take Baby May out in the side yard under the
trees with Flossie and Freddie. I want to
talk to your father undisturbed for a little
while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert had gone with Mr. Meekin to help
with the evening “chores,” and this left Mr.
and Mrs. Bobbsey free to talk when Nan had
taken Baby May and the smaller twins out
in the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think we had better do?”
asked Mrs. Bobbsey of her husband. “I don’t
like this shadow of a strange woman always
hovering over us and the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I. Suppose we go to some
other place, and go in such a way—perhaps at
night—that she can’t find us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that would be a good plan. She
must have inquired of the neighbors back in
Lakeport and so have traced us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so; though I thought we had
kept it quiet. But we don’t want to spoil the
children’s summer. I’ll look for another
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of footsteps on the side porch
was heard and, looking out, Mrs. Bobbsey
saw Nan coming in, followed by Freddie and
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shouldn’t come in and leave Baby
May out there all alone!” warned Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s all right,” said Nan. “She’s
sound asleep, and I can see the carriage from
here, and Flossie and Freddie wanted something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too near supper time,” said their
mother. “You must wait, my dears,” she
told the smaller twins. “Don’t spoil your
appetites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t spoil mine—it’s too big,” chuckled
Freddie. “I just wanted a cookie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their mother finally allowed them a cookie
apiece, for she found out that supper would be
a bit late, as Mrs. Meekin wanted to finish
skimming the milk as she was going to churn
the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nan decided she wanted a cookie for
herself, so it was perhaps five or ten minutes
before the children went back to where they
had left Baby May in the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, all the while, the carriage was in plain
sight from the porch. Even Mr. Bobbsey
could watch it, so nothing was feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nan and Flossie and Freddie, munching
their molasses cookies, went back to where
they had left Baby May, Nan gently raised
the coverings to see if May was still asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” Flossie wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is a bee stinging Baby May?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh, no!” cried Nan, and she was
very pale. “Baby May—she—she isn’t here!
She’s gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the porch Mrs. Bobbsey was watching.
She realized that something was wrong, and
she ran down to the carriage about which
Nan, Flossie and Freddie stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Nan?” she asked quickly. “Has
anything happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baby—Baby May!” sobbed Nan, “She’s
gone! She’s been kidnapped!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ON THE TRAIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie, Freddie and Nan were sobbing
now. Their tears fell thick and fast and they
wailed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children! Children! Be quiet!” ordered
Mrs. Bobbsey. “What does it all mean?
Baby May can’t have been taken. The carriage
has been in plain sight all the while.
She’s probably under the covers, Nan! Don’t
be silly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not si-si-silly, Mother! Baby May’s
gone! I—I felt under the covers and she—she
isn’t there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I can’t feel her to-toes!” sobbed Flossie,
her hand in the lower end of the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Mrs. Bobbsey herself had made
sure there was no baby in the carriage. She
took out all the coverings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must have tumbled out and crawled
away,” she said. “She can’t be gone! Look
in the grass and bushes, children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t she cry if she fell out?” Freddie
wanted to know. He had stopped crying when
his mother came along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She might not cry if she fell on soft leaves
and didn’t hurt herself,” answered Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Look carefully, children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all the looking in the world would not
have found Baby May just then, and it did
not take Mrs. Bobbsey long to make certain
that the infant was not around the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the worst has happened,” she said,
and there was the sound of tears in her own
voice. “Baby May didn’t fall out. She was
taken away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said she was kidnapped!” declared Nan.
“Soon as I didn’t see her in the carriage and
didn’t feel her, I knew she was kidnapped!
Oh, Mother! what are we going to do? Poor
Baby May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I want her back!” sobbed Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was that old woman—that old woman
with the green umbrella!” exclaimed Freddie.
“She took May off, I know she did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beginning to believe so,” said Mrs.
Bobbsey. “We must do something at once.
Call your father, Nan—oh, never mind. Here
he comes now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey had gone in the house after
Nan and the children had departed with their
cookies, and now he came out on the porch
again. Seeing his wife and the children gathered
around the carriage he seemed to guess
that something was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything happened?” he asked, as he
hurried across the grass. “Did May fall out?
Why, where is she?” he asked, seeing Nan
wheeling the empty carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Richard!” sobbed Mrs. Bobbsey, “the
little one is gone—kidnapped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! It isn’t possible! Under our very
eyes! How could it happen?” Mr. Bobbsey
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” his wife said. “But she’s
gone. The old woman must have sneaked up
between the time the children left the carriage
to get the cookies and the time they went
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she must have been hiding around
here, waiting for just such a chance,” declared
Mr. Bobbsey. “This is too much! I must
notify the police at once. An alarm must be
sent out and we must get on the trail of this
person. I believe she is crazy! She ought
not to be allowed at large with a baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will she—will she hurt Baby May?” asked
Flossie, alarmed by her father’s excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as his wife made him a signal to be
more careful, so as not to frighten the children,
Mr. Bobbsey said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I don’t believe the old woman will
hurt May. She must love her a great deal to
want to take her away. But anybody who will
leave an infant on the steps in a thunder storm
shouldn’t be allowed to have charge of children.
I’ll get the police after her at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one thing to speak about getting the
police to work, but it was quite another thing
to do this. In the quiet little hamlet of Pine
Hill there were no regular police officers—only
a constable or two and a justice of the peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Jim Denton is pretty smart,” said Mr.
Meekin, when he and his wife had been told of
the terrible happening. “I had a horse stolen
once, and Jim got it back for me in less than a
week. I’ll telephone him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Dad, can’t you and I take the trail
after this old woman ourselves?” asked Bert,
in a whisper of his father, while Mr. Meekin
was at the telephone, calling up the constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I intend to do what I can,” answered
Mr. Bobbsey. “I’ll take the auto and ride
along every road I think the old woman must
have taken. And you may go with me, Bert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you think that will be wise?” asked
his wife, overhearing what was said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” her husband answered. “Bert will
be a help to me. We may have to be gone all
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert’s eyes sparkled with pleasure as his
father said this. It might be a great adventure!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bert, you must take good care of yourself,”
said his mother anxiously. “I wouldn’t have
anything happen to you for the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll be all right, don’t worry,” returned
the son, with all the confidence of a growing
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that woman may not be as nice as you
think. For all we know, she may be crazy and
liable to do any wicked thing,” remarked Mrs.
Meekin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll keep my eyes open,” declared Bert sturdily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim’ll be right over in his car,” said Mr.
Meekin, as he hung up the telephone. “And
while we’re waiting, let’s look the ground over
and see what happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you must have supper—I’ll get it
ready right away,” said Mrs. Meekin. “Land
sakes! To think of such things happening!
My goodness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bustled off to get the meal, which was
almost ready, and Mr. Bobbsey, with Bert
and Mr. Meekin, went to the place where the
carriage had been left for just a few minutes
alone with Baby May in it. And yet those
few minutes were enough for the kidnapping
to have taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That it was a kidnapping—and done by the
strange old woman in the faded shawl and with
the green umbrella—all were now certain. Of
course no one had seen her, but everything
pointed to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She just waited her chance and then
sneaked up,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed to have been the manner of
it. The back of the carriage was turned
toward the house, to keep the sun out of May’s
eyes as she lay asleep. It would have been an
easy matter for the old woman—or any one
else—to have sneaked up and taken the baby.
She could lift the child, asleep as she was, out
of the carriage under the cover of the hood,
and the children and Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey
on the porch could not see this take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t see anything here,” said Mr.
Meekin, looking all around the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” agreed Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take a look up and down the road,”
suggested Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nothing was in sight—no one in view.
This was not strange, as there were trees and
bushes on either side of the highway, and it
would have been an easy matter for the kidnapper
to have concealed herself in these for a
moment, or longer, and then to have taken
some hidden path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we must get on the trail at once,”
said Mr. Bobbsey. “You have the police, or
whoever does such things, send out a general
alarm, Mr. Meekin. Bert and I will start off
in our car, and when Jim Denton comes, he can
do his part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim’s pretty good,” repeated Mr. Meekin.
“He got back my horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Meekin had supper ready in a “jiffy,”
as she called it. The meal was not quite over
when some one was heard running up the side
porch. It was some one in a hurry, that was
very plain.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch20'>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AN EXCITING CHASE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Bobbsey twins stopped eating and
looked one at the other. What could it mean—this
hurried rush of some one up the steps?
Then Flossie spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it’s the old woman bringing back
Baby May,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is, I’m going to catch her!” declared
Freddie, getting ready to slip down from his
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit still, children,” ordered Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert acted as though, he, too, would like to
see who it was, for, as yet, the caller was not
in view. But a look from his father kept Bert
in his seat. He looked at Nan in a disappointed
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Jim Denton,” announced Mr. Meekin,
as he saw the hurrying visitor through the
open door. “Come right in, Jim!” he called.
“Had your supper? If you haven’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I ate long ago,” announced the caller,
who was the constable, or chief policeman, for
Pine Hill. “What’s all the excitement about?”
he asked. “Have you had another horse
stolen, Pete?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not a horse this time. It’s worse—a
little baby,” said Mr. Meekin. “Didn’t they
tell you at the post-office, where I telephoned
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they didn’t say what it was. Just said
something was missing over here and for me
to hurry. I did, as soon as I could get a bite
to eat. But what do you mean—a baby taken?
Is it lost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse’n that, Jim,” said the farmer. “It’s
a kidnapping case. You want to do your best
on this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” promised the constable. “Tell me
all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let Mr. Bobbsey do that,” said Mr.
Meekin. “It’s his baby; or at least he and his
wife took care of it. And it was stolen out of
the carriage, right in my yard, Jim, with folks
on the side porch. Greatest mystery we ever
had here! The children left the baby a
moment and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, I thought you were going to let Mr.
Bobbsey tell the story,” remarked Jim, with a
smile, as he looked at his watch. “If this is
a kidnapping case the sooner we get on the
trail and chase after the kidnapper the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. You tell him, Mr. Bobbsey,”
begged Mr. Meekin. “I get so excited thinking
about it that my tongue runs away with
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the story was told, the Bobbsey twins
telling their share in the sorrowful affair of
how Baby May was stolen right out of her
carriage, when she was left alone but for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” remarked Constable Jim Denton,
when the story was finished. “It is very
strange. I’ll take a look at the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t find any clews there, because
we looked,” said Bert, with a very grown-up
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe, I won’t. But I’ll take a look,
just the same,” replied the constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went with him while he looked
over the place where the carriage had been left
just before Baby May was stolen from it. As
Bert had said, there was little in the way of
clews, or anything to tell who the kidnapper
was or which way she had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That it was the strange woman with the
faded shawl and the green umbrella, every one
felt sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard something about that old woman
hanging around these parts,” the constable
said, “but I’ve never laid eyes on her. This
time I hope I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to help in the search,” said Mr.
Bobbsey. “My son and I will go off in our
auto, but of course we’ll act under your orders,
Mr. Denton, as you are in charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know that I have any special
orders,” the constable said slowly. “The main
thing is to catch that old woman and get back
the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I want Baby May back!” sighed
Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I want her, too,” said Flossie, with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you an automobile, Mr. Denton?”
asked the father of the Bobbsey twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, some folks call it that, and then
again they speak of it as a tin Lizzie,”
chuckled the constable. “It gets me where I
want to go and back again. Well, we’d better
start if we’re going,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I think,” agreed Mr. Bobbsey.
“And as there is no telling which way this old
woman has gone, one of us can go up the main
road, and the other down the main road until
we get some sort of clew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good idea,” said the constable. “It
ought not to be hard to find this old woman.
Traveling with a baby, as she is, some one is
bound to take notice of her. It’ll be an easier
case than your lost horse, Pete,” he said to Mr.
Meekin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I hope so,” said Mrs. Meekin, who
had learned to love Baby May, as had every
one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After arranging to telephone in as soon as
he should have any news, Constable Jim Denton
went off in his little automobile, going up
the road, or toward the next town of Rosemount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bert, I guess we’d better start on our
part of the chase,” said Mr. Bobbsey to his
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it safe to take Bert with
you?” asked Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother, I want to go!” pleaded Bert.
“Crickity grasshoppers—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your father may be on the road all
night—or at least away all night, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can stay up all night, Mother!” insisted
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be all right,” said Mr. Bobbsey, with
a smile. “And I may need him to help me.
We sha’n’t travel quite all night. If we get
too far away to return by, say, eleven o’clock,
we’ll stay at a hotel all night. Don’t worry,
Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed his wife good-bye, and kissed
Nan, Flossie and Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring back Baby May!” said Bert firmly,
as he, too, kissed his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I hope so,” murmured Mrs. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey and Bert took the “down road,”
as it was called, leading to the city of Millville,
though the city itself was several miles away.
However, there were small towns and villages
in between, and it was thought that some news
might be obtained in one of these of the old
woman and Baby May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she might go off into the woods and
camp there, like a gypsy,” suggested Bert, as
he and his father started off in the automobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I hardly think so,” replied Mr. Bobbsey.
“A little baby like May would not fare
very well if kept out all night in a camp in
the woods—that is, unless the woman had a
tent, and I don’t believe she has that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where has she been staying all the
while she’s been spying on us and trying to
get the baby back?” asked Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I can’t find out,” said his
father. “She must have lived somewhere
around here, and yet we can’t get a trace of
her. If she boarded with any of the farmers
we would have heard about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe she found an old hut or cabin, and
is staying in that,” said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” his father admitted. “Well,
we’ll inquire all along as we go, and we may
find her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stopped at the first house they passed
after leaving the home of Mr. Meekin. But
the people there had not seen a woman and
baby going past. They asked all sorts of
questions, wanting to know all about the kidnapping,
but Mr. Bobbsey did not have time
to say much. As soon as he found out they
could tell him nothing he hurried on with
Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same at the next half dozen houses
they stopped at—no one had seen the kidnapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must keep on with the search,”
said Mr. Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” agreed Bert. “I want to get
back Baby May!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch21'>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IN THE DUCK POND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, back in the house at Pine
Hill, the other Bobbsey children and their
mother waited anxiously for news from Bert
and his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Nan was sure the two would come
back in an hour after setting off, bringing
back Baby May. But when the long hand of
the clock had gone slowly all around the face
twice, making two hours, Nan sighed and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess it’s going to take longer than I
thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid so,” agreed her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie and Freddie, however, though just
as anxious to get back Baby May as were Bert
and Nan, did not think so much about the
kidnapping of the little one. Flossie and Freddie
liked to have fun all the while, and just
waiting for some one to come back was not
much fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s do something,” proposed Freddie,
after a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Flossie. “What’ll we
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie thought for a few moments. Then
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go wading in the pond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-o-o-oo!” exclaimed Flossie, her eyes
opening wide in surprise. “Mother said we
mustn’t go there!” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was yesterday,” said Freddie, with a
shake of his curly head. “Yesterday it looked
like it was going to rain, and she told us not to
go to the pond. To-day it isn’t going to rain,
so we can go to the pond and wade—with our
shoes and stockings off,” he went on, after
another thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure?” asked Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course I’m sure,” answered Freddie.
“Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps if Flossie had not wanted so much
to go and wade in the pond she might have
thought more of what her mother had said the
day before. This was that neither she nor
Freddie was to go in wading. But then Freddie
might be right. Mrs. Bobbsey might not
have wanted the children to play in the water
when it was likely to rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the sun was shining and the water of
the pond sparkled in the bright light. The
pond was out of sight of the house. It was
a place where a brook widened out, making
a swimming space for the ducks. Flossie and
Freddie had been allowed to sail toy boats on
it, but had not been allowed to go in wading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too muddy,” Mrs. Bobbsey had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now the two little Bobbsey twins made
their way down to this pond, no one in the
house seeing them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get my shoes and stockings off before
you do!” cried Freddie, sitting down on the
ground near the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not! I can beat you!” cried
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did, but she tore one of her stockings
while taking it off in such a hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beat! I beat!” she cried, dancing up and
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you tore your stocking!” cried Freddie,
pointing to the hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care—it was an old stocking,” replied
Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, I’ll get in wading first!”
shouted Freddie. He made a dash toward
the water, Flossie following closely after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh!” suddenly cried the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie turned and saw that she had fallen
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hurt yourself, Flossie?” asked her
brother kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“N-n-no; not mu-mu-much!” she stammered.
“Is my—now, is my nose red?” she
asked, raising her head from the ground,
where she still lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie ran forward and dipped one foot
in the water of the pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s to show I beat and got in first,” he
said. Then he went back to Flossie who was
still stretched out on the ground. He wanted
to be kind to his sister, but a race was a race.
“Your nose is a little red,” he went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it bleeding?” Flossie wanted to know,
about ready to cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t bleeding,” Freddie answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I guess it’s all right,” Flossie went
on. “Please help me up, Freddie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freddie did this, and the two barefooted
Bobbsey twins, hand in hand, walked toward
the pond. Freddie did not care now if Flossie
got in ahead of him, for he had wet his feet
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Flossie was a bit timid, so she
stood on the edge of the pond and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wade in again, Freddie, and tell me if it’s
very deep and if it’s cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t deep and it isn’t cold,” declared
Freddie. “I’ll show you, Flossie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waded boldly out into the pond, splashing
about and getting the bottoms of his
little trousers wet. He turned toward Flossie,
to tell her to come on out, but, suddenly, a
queer look came over the little boy’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Flossie!” he cried. “Something’s got
me by the toe! Oh, I guess it’s a mud turkle!
Go call mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie paused for a moment on the edge of
the pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on! Go on!” cried Freddie, dancing
about with one foot out of the water. The
other seemed stuck in the mud. “Go on. Call
mother! Tell her a mud turkle has me by the
toe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see any turkle,” remarked Flossie.
Both she and Freddie called it “turkle,” instead
of turtle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the turkle is here all right!” Freddie
exclaimed. “He has me by the toe! Maybe
it’s a snapping turkle ’stid of a mud turkle!
But go call mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away ran Flossie, and she was soon gasping
to her mother:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got him by the toe! It’s got him by
the toe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has who by the toe?” asked Mrs.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The turkle has Freddie by the toe,” explained
Flossie. “Come on, Mother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is Freddie?” asked his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down in the duck pond,” answered Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you not to go wading there?”
exclaimed Mrs. Bobbsey. But she did not wait
for Flossie to answer. On hurried the mother
of the Bobbsey twins, Flossie keeping alongside
of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Freddie said it was all right to go in wading
to-day, ’cause it was yesterday you said we
couldn’t go in,” remarked Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my goodness!” gasped Mrs. Bobbsey.
“Such children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time she was within sight of the
pond where Freddie stood near the edge. He
was crying and was splashed from head to
foot with muddy water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Freddie! Are you hurt, child?” called
his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The—the turkle’s—got hold of my toe yet
and he won’t let go!” Freddie sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a plank on the edge of the pond,
and, pushing this out into the water, Mrs.
Bobbsey stepped on it until she could reach the
little boy without getting her own feet wet.
She put her arms around Freddie and lifted
him from the water. That is, she tried to lift
him, but at first he did not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s stuck in the mud!” shouted Flossie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my foot! The turkle has hold of it!”
screamed Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a very large turtle!” gasped
Mrs. Bobbsey. But she did not really believe
that a turtle had hold of the little boy’s foot,
though he certainly was held fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave another pull, and this time Freddie
came up in her arms. Something was dangling
from one foot. At the sight of it Flossie, on
the bank, set up a shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t a turkle after all!” cried the little
girl. “It’s a big jug!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was. Freddie, wading about in
the pond, had stuck his big toe in the mouth
of a brown jug that some one had thrown into
the duck pond. The jug had stuck to the little
boy’s foot, and to him it seemed exactly as
if a “turkle” had him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mrs. Bobbsey raised Freddie up in her
arms, the jug fell from his toe and splashed
back into the pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There goes your turtle,” said his mother.
“My! what a time you’ve had! You shouldn’t
have gone in wading, Flossie and Freddie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told him you said not to,” remarked the
little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I didn’t think you meant to-day,” observed
Freddie, as he sat down on the grass
and looked carefully at his big toe. Aside
from being red, like Flossie’s nose, it was not
cut or hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t want you to go in wading any time
in this pond,” said the children’s mother.
“There is broken glass in it and pieces of tin
on which you might cut your feet. That’s
why I wanted you to stay out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” murmured Freddie. “I thought it
was ’cause you didn’t want us to get wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go in again!” warned Mrs. Bobbsey,
and thinking Freddie had been frightened
enough she did not punish him any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I tore my stocking a little,” confessed
Flossie, wanting to have all the unpleasant
things over with at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too bad,” said her mother. “You
should have minded me. Well, put on your
shoes and we’ll go back to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One might have thought this would be the
last of the adventures of Flossie and Freddie
for that day, but it was not. Just before sunset
they went out in the barn to play in the hay.
They slid on the sweet-smelling dried grass
for a time, coasting down from the mow to
the barn floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Flossie had an idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s hunt where the hens lay their eggs
and bring in some,” proposed the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be fun,” agreed Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crawled about in the hay, looking here
and there for nests with white eggs in them.
Suddenly Flossie gave a cry as she felt herself
slipping on the smooth hay into a hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Freddie, who
was in another part of the barn. “Did you
find a nest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flossie answered “yes,” for she had found a
nest. She had slid right into one containing
nearly a dozen eggs. She had sat down on
them, smashing the eggs and covering herself
with broken shells and sticky whites and
yellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’d better call mother!” sighed
Flossie, when she saw what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is worser than when the jug-turkle
caught me by the toe!” shouted Freddie, as
he dashed for the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my goodness, what will happen next?”
sighed Mrs. Bobbsey, when she saw the woeful
sight of Flossie, very dirty, sitting in the nest,
for right there the little girl had stayed, waiting
for her mother to come to her. She took the
little girl into the house to clean her, and
when Flossie had on dry clothes her mother
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you and Freddie stay on the porch
until bedtime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Daddy and Bert will come
back soon?” asked Freddie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said their mother. “At any rate,
I hope so.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CAUGHT AT LAST</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Bert and his father were
keeping on with the search for Baby May.
Once they saw an old woman going along the
road ahead of them, carrying a sack over her
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, maybe she has Baby May in that bag!”
cried Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father hardly thought so, but speeded
up the auto until they reached the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you a baby in that sack?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodness, no! I should hope not,”
answered the woman, with a laugh. “I’ve got
potatoes in here. Why would I be carrying
a baby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Bobbsey explained that he and
Bert were looking for a kidnapper and they
inquired of the “potato woman,” as they called
her, whether she had seen anything of Baby
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t,” she answered. “I’ve just
been after these potatoes, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the bag was heavy, Mr. Bobbsey gave
the woman and her potatoes a ride to the
woman’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said, as she got down. “I
hope you find that kidnapper and the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may get some news of her in the
morning,” said Mr. Bobbsey, for it was now
getting on toward night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two in the automobile kept on to the
next town where Mr. Bobbsey had decided to
stay all night. There was little use in going
farther, and they could get no news of the
strange woman by inquiring at the post-office
and the stores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bert and his father went to the one hotel
in the place, and from there they telephoned
back to Mrs. Bobbsey at Pine Hill, telling her
their plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose you have any news, have
you?” asked Mr. Bobbsey of his wife over the
wire. “Did Jim Denton get any clews?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she answered. “He found some
persons who had seen the old woman, carrying
a bundle, going down the road. That was the
baby, I’m sure. But Jim lost trace of the
woman. Very likely she got a ride in some
auto. But he’s going to keep right on with
the search.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she went down his part of the road,
then there isn’t much use in our keeping on
this way,” said Mr. Bobbsey. “Bert and I
will return in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was decided. Bert was rather sorry
his adventure had come to such an end, for he
hoped they might get some trace of the strange
woman in the direction he and his father had
taken, but it was not to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning Mr. Bobbsey and Bert went
back to Pine Hill, reaching there about ten
o’clock. Soon after they arrived they had a
telephone message from Mr. Denton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The old woman was seen around the town
of Cardley,” the constable said. “You’d better
go over there, and I’ll meet you. I don’t know
her and I might make a mistake and pick out
the wrong one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll know that old woman again, if I see
her!” exclaimed Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll know Baby May,” added his
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, can’t I go with you?” begged Nan, as
her father and brother were about to start
off again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might take her with you,” suggested
Mrs. Bobbsey. “If you do get Baby May
back Nan can take care of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Nan was allowed to go. Flossie and
Freddie cried and begged to go also, but this
was not permitted. However, their mother
promised to take them on a picnic to pass the
time until the others should return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Constable Jim Denton proved to be a good
detective. He had finally got trace of the old
woman carrying the baby, and he found that,
as had been thought, she had been given a
ride—a “lift,” the constable called it—by a
kind farmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He left her in Cardley, and she said she
was going to stay there all night,” Mr.
Denton explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bobbsey made good speed to Cardley
and found the constable there waiting for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the old woman?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey, as he met the constable at the village
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s stopping at a farmhouse just outside
the town,” he said. “I located her, but
I didn’t want to make any move to arrest her,
for fear she’d get excited and maybe hurt the
baby, or steal off again. She’s pretty well
tired out, from what I hear, and I guess it
will be an easy matter to catch her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Baby May all right?” Nan asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bless your heart, yes!” replied Mr.
Denton. “I guess the old woman took good
care of the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went out to the farmhouse in Mr.
Bobbsey’s automobile, as the constable said
his little car had a flat tire. As they approached
the place Nan and Bert saw, standing
out in the front yard, a figure they well
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was that of the strange old woman they
had first seen passing their house and later
sneaking around Pine Hill. As soon as the
woman, who was without her shawl now and
who did not have an umbrella, saw them, she
made a dash toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jim Denton was too quick for her.
Leaping from the automobile while it was still
moving, he caught her by the arm and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t! We have you now! You
can’t get away with the baby again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman did not struggle. Indeed,
now that she was caught, she seemed very
calm and not at all queer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she said. “I am not going to
run away. You will find everything all right.
I have a very good claim to this baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you’ll have to explain to the police,”
said Mr. Bobbsey, in a stern voice. “Where
is Baby May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her name isn’t May. It’s Jenny,” returned
the old woman, with a faint smile.
“Jenny Watson. If you’ll come in I’ll explain
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonderingly the two Bobbsey twins
followed their father, the constable and the
old woman into the farmhouse. The old
woman suddenly burst into tears as she was
about to open the door of a room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope nothing has happened to Baby
May,” said Mr. Bobbsey, for he and his wife
had grown to love the baby very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, Jenny is all right. She is asleep,
I think,” said the old woman. “But I feel so
bad over all that has happened. It wasn’t
exactly my fault—I couldn’t help it. But if
I had not gotten the baby back! Oh, it would
have been terrible!” She wiped away her
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t feel bad,” said Mr. Bobbsey kindly.
“Of course I don’t understand it at all—why
you should abandon the baby and then kidnap
her—but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” whispered the old lady, putting
her finger to her lips as she stepped into the
darkened room. Softly she raised the curtain,
and there on a bed Nan and the others saw
the baby sweetly sleeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the little darling!” murmured Nan.
“I’m so glad we have her back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear,” whispered the old woman,
“I’m afraid I can’t let you have her back. You
see she has a father and mother of her own,
and they will want their baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you aren’t the mother?” asked Mr.
Bobbsey, more and more puzzled over the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am not Jenny’s mother,” was the
answer. “If you will come into the next room,
where we can talk without waking baby, I’ll
tell you the story. It is a very strange one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Mr. Bobbsey, when they were
all seated in a pleasant room of the farmhouse
where, the old woman said, she had
engaged board for herself and the baby, “we
are now ready for the story. And then I must
telephone to my wife that the baby is all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wife took very good care of Jenny,
and I want to thank her when I see her,” said
the old woman. “Now I will be as short as I
can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name,” she said, “is Sarah Martin.
I have been a widow for a number of years.
Several months ago my cousin, Mrs. Henry
Watson, came to me and said her husband had
to go to South America on a business trip,
and she felt that she ought to go with him, as
he was not in very good health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did not think it would be safe to
take the baby to South America with them,
so I agreed to look after little Jenny—that’s
her real name—Jenny Watson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We called her May Washington Bobbsey,”
said Bert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did that,” explained his father, “because
we found her on the first day of May,
and we understood from the railroad men
that you had given a name that sounded like
Washington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wassingham was my name before I was
married,” explained Mrs. Martin. “Very
likely I gave that name when I was out of my
mind—partly crazy, I guess I must have been—and
they understood me to say Washington.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that on account of the baby?” asked
the constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not exactly. But the fact that I had
lost Jenny made me feel worse,” replied Mrs.
Martin. “Well, as I was telling you, my
cousin and her husband went to South America
and left Jenny with me. They were to be
gone about six months, and they are now on
their way home. If I hadn’t been able to get
Jenny for them before they arrived, I don’t
know what I would have done!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything went along nicely for the first
month. I kept Jenny with me in my home at
Blakeville, and she grew and thrived. Then,
one day, when I was cleaning a closet, some
dishes fell on my head. I was knocked unconscious,
and when I was able to get up I had
a queer feeling. I wasn’t myself. I seemed
to have forgotten my name, and all I could
remember about the baby was a feeling that
I ought to get rid of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, not really knowing what I was doing,
I put her in a basket, wrapped a shawl around
myself, and, taking a green umbrella, I set
out. I had only one idea in mind—to leave
the baby at some house where there were other
children. I must have felt that in such a place
she would be well taken care of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took the train from my home to your
town, though I don’t remember anything about
getting off the train. I do remember, though,
tramping around in the rain. I saw some
children’s faces at a window, and I made up
my mind that would be a good house at which
to leave the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was our house,” murmured Nan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dearie, that must have been your
house,” said Mrs. Martin. “Well, once I had
picked out the house, I lingered around until
after dark, and then, making sure the baby was
well protected in the basket, I left her on your
doorstep and, ringing the bell, slipped off in
the rain and darkness. I hid myself and
watched to see if the door would be opened,
and when it wasn’t, I went softly up again and
rang the bell a second time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We thought it was the lightning making
the bell ring,” explained Bert, “for we couldn’t
see any one on the steps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I slipped away as soon as I rang the
bell, and I suppose you didn’t notice the basket
in the darkness,” said Mrs. Martin. “But after
I had rung the bell the second time I felt sure
you would take in the baby, so I slipped away
for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened for several weeks after
that, I don’t remember. But finally some one
noticed that I was acting queerly, and I was
taken to a hospital, and there I was cured.
Then when I remembered what I had done—taken
Baby Jenny away and deserted her—I
went nearly crazy again. I tried to remember
where I had left her, but for a long time I
couldn’t. Then, when I did get to your house,
I watched my chance to take the baby away
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you come in and tell us your
story?” asked Mr. Bobbsey. “We would have
given you back the baby had we known.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid you wouldn’t believe me,”
answered Mrs. Martin. “So I watched my
chance. I managed to find out that you had
gone to Pine Hill, and I followed you there.
Then I kept on waiting for an opportunity to
take back the baby, as I had a right to do. At
last, yesterday, my chance came. I saw Baby
Jenny asleep in her carriage, I slipped up and
took her out. Then I slipped away, hiding in
the woods until after dark, and getting a ride
until I reached this place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought everything would be all right
and that I could restore the baby to her
parents, who are expected home in a few days.
But when I saw you coming I feared you
would take her away from me again, so I
rushed in here. Then I decided to tell you the
whole story. I knew I had a right to the baby,
now that my mind is well again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you have a right to the baby
until her parents come,” said Mr. Bobbsey.
“It has been a queer mix-up all around, and
I am very sorry for you. Have you written
to Mr. and Mrs. Watson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t write and tell them I had lost the
baby,” answered Mrs. Martin. “I didn’t dare
do that. But I had a cablegram from them
asking how Jenny was, and to-day I sent them
a message, saying she was well. For indeed she
is. Your wife took very good care of her.
Oh, I am so sorry for all the trouble I have
caused,” and the old woman wept again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t help it,” said Mr. Bobbsey
kindly. “Perhaps you had better come back
and stay with my wife until Mr. and Mrs.
Watson arrive from South America. Bring
Baby Jenny and stay with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, please do!” begged Nan. “We
won’t know what to do without Baby May—I
mean Baby Jenny!” she quickly corrected
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll do that,” said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were very excited and began
making plans for taking care of the infant.
They were to get good practise for their next
adventure to be known as “The Bobbsey Twins
Keeping House.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going to the farm, they telephoned
the news to Mrs. Bobbsey at Pine Hill, and
there was a happy meeting when, once more,
the baby was with those who had cared for the
little foundling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor woman! How you must have
suffered,” said Mrs. Bobbsey to Mrs. Martin,
after having heard the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will never know how terrible it was
when I realized that I had given the baby away—left
her on a strange doorstep. And then
I couldn’t remember for a long while where
it was!” said Mrs. Martin. “But now it has
all ended happily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it had, for a few days later the
ship bearing Mr. and Mrs. Watson came in
from South America, and the parents made a
quick trip out to Pine Hill, where the mother
gathered into her arms the baby who had gone
through so many strange adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one blamed Mrs. Martin, for it was an
accident, though undoubtedly if she had come
to the Bobbseys and explained everything, instead
of trying to kidnap the baby, it would
have been much better. But, as she said, she
hardly knew what she was doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wish we could keep the baby,” said
Nan. “But maybe something else will happen
pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” agreed Bert. “Anyhow, it was
exciting while it lasted.” And the other
Bobbsey twins agreed with this.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
